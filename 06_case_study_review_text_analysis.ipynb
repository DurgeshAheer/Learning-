First experience was very positive - would definitely return!\\n\\nATMOSPHERE: Small space. Think Banh Mi Boys, and other trendy over-the-counter eateries. Vibe is casual. Free WiFi is nice.\\n\\nSERVICE: Okay. Staff does their job, but not overly helpful upon entering the space. Maybe because it\\'s an over-the-counter style place, but it would have been nice to be walked through their ordering process and menu.\\n\\nPRICE: Average. Depends on the size of pizza you order.The small pizza ($7-9.50) is filling for one. Large size pizza ($13-18.50) is good for sharing... or one VERY hungry person.  Pasta portions are very generous for the price tag ($9-14)\\n\\n\\nFOOD: My friends and I were here for the first time, and we thought it was a pizza place so we all ordered pizza. It wasn\\'t until we were waiting for the food to come, that we looked around and realised EVERY other table around us only had pasta on them. Guess we gotta come back to try! We did notice that the menu said their pasta is homemade. So will definitely come back.\\n\\nHere\\'s the pizza we ordered:\\n\\nPeking Duck Pizza - Very tasty! Rich flavours that work well. But it\\'s heavy, so come hungry - or order to share.\\n\\nMargherita - Good, but not the best. I recommend trying the more \"special\" toppings instead.\\n\\nShall return, and/or try other locations.'"

       "'i ordered a pizza at 4:49. got an email that said my pizza would be delivered at 5:18 to5:28. 5:38 still no pizza. called the store. they said it was out for delivery. i said i knew that it was suppose to be delivered 10 minutes ago. 5:48. still no pizza. called the store back. again, i was told it was out for delivery. 5:48 called the store again. when i was on the phone the pizza came. when it arrived it was cold. the most low quality catering in persian catagory. we had party on persian new year and every one paid for the food to be cater through this place.\\nthe food was not even enough for everybody and the quality was bad.\\ni feel so bad for this business, seriously, where are the vegetarian options? all the dishes (even the salads) have either meat, fish, poultry or eggs in them. i have heard that this place is good from my friends but i can\\'t join them since there is nothing for vegetarian or vegan people to eat here. vegetarianism is becoming more popular everyday and restaurants like this one have to learn to adapt and cater the needs and wants of people becoming vegetarians or vegans. sadly, this is one of many restaurants who fail to understand this change. there are very few places where vegetarian or vegan people can have a proper meal. i\\'ll come here only when there is a proper vegetarian/vegan menu in place. really filthy silverware asked for new set  just as bad  asked for ketchup disgusting!!! see photo. italian beef so-so. fries were good. but fries don\\'t make a restaurant. where ever this chain started they need to go back.  hate to see the kitchen if what they bring out is this bad. there\\'s so many restaurants that take pride in cleanliness,this was certainly doesn\\'t!!! if you go don\\'t say i didn\\'t warn you. if i could i could give 0 stars i would. so we show up around 5:30pm on a monday. place is pretty empty. ordered drink which took about 30 mins to get. ice was already melted in my drink. ordered apps and meals. we did not get out food until 7:30. we waited a hour and a half for food @ a empty upscale pizza shop. btw my pizza was cold. and there is some manager guy walking around looking busy but what a joke. also i ordered a calzone which was not a calzone. crust chandler simply italian is a joke of a place and anyone that waste there money obviously does not care about the food they put in there mouth or any kind of service. what a rip off. just remember every time someone has a bad experience they tell 10 people. i was with 4 people. that\\'s 50 people in day. i think the major issue is the customer base has no clue what good italian is. it sad that so many people accept this. i stopped in because harumi sushi no longer serves dinner options, only sushi. upon entering the restaurant i was greeted by a nice woman. after glancing over the menu, i chose the lasagna, which comes with sourdough bread. i wasn\\'t in a dine-in mood so i took the order togo. the restaurant was clean and i only waited about ten minutes to receive the meal. however, the clean environment and short wait time cannot make up for the bad taste of the food. the lasagna was horrible!! it taste extremely bad and i don\\'t know if it is just me or not but when did lasagna start being made with carrots? moral of the story is, i will not be returning again! fix your store, it is so poorly run that i cannot even go there. there are never pizzas ready, they don\\'t answer the phone to make orders, the employees are rude and condescending and the customers are trash!\\n\\nour neighborhood is not this gross but if i was from outside the area, i would think it\\'s the slums. totally unacceptable, get this store fixed immediately. no excuses.\\n\\nit also has a foul odor to it...the pizza is worth 5 or 6 bucks...nothing special just fix your stupid store and standards this hot and ready pizza was definitely not the greatest.  the pepperoni is clustered around the center.  the sauce has a spicy kick to it, and neither my children not myself liked it.  the crazy bread is tasty though. waiter was good but the steak gorgonzola was a small portion for the price and where me and my wife was there was several nat\\'s flying and went into my food we had to move got the food there was comp or anything spent 50 dollars for bug food afterwards my wife went to talk to the manager saying we will not return he asked if we paid and we said yes and he sorry we can\\'t do anything have a nice day stay away if you want bugs in your food unless you don\\'t mind paying the money for bug food i will never return to this one i\\'ll drive to go to my other one nfl football on and i\\'m listening to casey kasum tip hits from 1978. what is the target demographic? this isn\\'t the only time i left due to terrible ambiance. i\\'ll keep  giving this place a chance because of the happy hour pizza and wings. i hope they will find an identity. i know you\\'re salty because your food tastes like it, chefs are creepy and sweaty mixed with frump and seems very unsanitary, waitress is a huge snail yet there is no escargot on the menu? everything sucks.. looks so dirty i swear i sat in the chair and dust flew up. if i could give zero stars i would, 1 even seems to be too much. party of four wishes we would\\'ve went to our regular ballentines spot for a steak and fries. used to be a good place. has gone downhill the last few years. i already know their pizza is not good anymore, it was when they first opened, but i was in the mood for pasta and decided to give them a chance to redeem themselves . \\n\\ni ordered to go and when i got their at 8 pm on a saturday night and there was only one two person table and no other people in the restaurant, i had a feeling something wasn\\'t right. \\nspent $23.17 on two pastas to go. one the was spaghetti with meat sauce, i would compare it to a can of chef boyardee. the other was a pesto pasta with chicken, not very good either. \\n\\nthrew them both in the trash\\n\\nafter this meal, i also threw my streets of new york takeout menu in the trash used to be good, been here a few times on previous vegas visits however, this time we both got sick. our friends went there the next day and they too got sick. something not right. they don\\'t want your business so if you call don\\'t be surprised if you are put on perpetual hold. they will not pick up. must be sorely understaffed. i am sure the food must be okay since it\\'s pizza hut. one of the worst pizzas i\\'ve ever had. the cooks are really cheap when it comes to cheese (the pizza was almost all tomato sauce) because the cheese was missing. absolutely no taste. i don\\'t usually bad reviews unless earned and these ppl working here certainly earned a bad review. maybe the owner is a cheap person and is forcing cooks to be cheap with toppings. if your open sign is on, it\\'s twenty minutes until your posted closing time, and all the lights are on, don\\'t look at me like i\\'m an idiot for wanting to place an order. (the floors were already wet and they\\'d been in the process of closing for awhile judging by the bleach smell.) \\n\\nseriously, i wonder if the manager knows about shutting down a full half hour before closing. ordered online at 5:45pm to have our food delivered...still had not received it by 9:45pm. went back another day  to pick up a to go order.. waited an additional hour and a half in restaurant.. food was alright, will try again in a few months when they get their system down. my review is based on my experience with the management, not the food. the food is just ok, nothing to write home about. secret pizza at cosmo is better.\\n\\nthe manager on duty failed to do his duties when i requested him to call security to come assist me when i was being harassed by a drunk belligerent man while in line. i felt unsafe and wanted security to come but the manager never called them. he in fact lied to me saying that they were too busy to assist me. i spoke to security later on that night and they told me they never received a call. \\n\\nshame on you manager on duty sunday 1:30am for lying about calling security. ayant déjà été aux états-unis, j\\'évitais son ouverture à laval comme la peste. j\\'ai quand même dû y aller pour faire plaisir à une amie. un mot : mauvais, tout est mauvais, les pâtes, les pizza, les frites, tout!!!! je suis assez ouverte pour les restos et donne la chance au coureur, mais celui-ci est à éviter. faites quelques pas un peu plus loin dans le centropolis et vous aurez une dizaine de restos qui vous regardent en pleine face. this kfc is no longer a part of the major kfc franchise and it is really obvious because for one the customer service is the very worst! yes don! this means you! you served us some nasty ass burnt chicken and didn\\'t even give us a receipt with our order. when we got home we opened the bucket and it looked like the chicken had been burnt in a fire! it was old, really dark and hard as a rock. so we drove all the way back to return it and don had the nerve to tell us there wasn\\'t anything wrong with it! well, i\\'m not serving that crap to my family.. matter of fact i don\\'t even think they are using the 11 herbs and spices cause it didn\\'t look anything like the real kfc chicken. anyway do not go to this kfc.. we tried to call them and the number on the internet is disconnected so i asked don for the manager\\'s number and he refused to give it to me.. he told me i had to go back the next day and talk to the owner.. this kfc should be called kentucky fakeass chicken! california pizza kitchen has always been one of those places that everyone can agree on. the menu is big enough where there is something for everyone and usually everyone walks away happy. lately though, the quality of the food as gone way down. \\n\\nbefore i went vegetarian i used to always get the chicken waldorf salad and it was always so good. i love the blue cheese and the candied walnuts. they were addicting. since i\\'ve become vegetarian i settled on the hummus appetizer, grilled vegetable salad, and the wild mushroom pizza. recently though, they have completed revamped the menu, adding new items, taking old favorites off. for some places, menu changes mean new and exciting food opportunities and makes the visit to that place even better. not for cpk. \\n\\nrecently, since beginning to use yelp, i have wanted to try new places and veer away from old favorites or places that i am used to. however, i tend to have friends and family members who are food-borists... ya i just invented a new word. a food-borist is someone who never wants to try anything new, and will eat at the same place and order the same exact thing all of the time. my friends are this way. it never fails. any time one of them has a birthday i get an invitation to eat at cpk and every time i groan. even before i swore off cpk forever, i was getting extremely tired of it. the second to the last time i went was for my birthday with some friends. i ordered the new roasted vegetable salad and a cup of the vegetarian tortilla soup. i used to love the grilled vegetable salad and was pissed when they replaced it on the menu with roasted vegetable salad. not good. i struggled through it because my friends paid for my dinner and i didn\\'t want to waste their money. but it was gross, and i vowed never to order it again. the soup was good though. the last time i went was with my sister, husband and niece. this time i ordered the new caramelized peach salad. on the menu, most of the new items sound really good. its just the execution of them that fails cpk. the peach salad was gross. the peaches were canned and then warmed, and i also saw no caramelization whatsoever. the combination of the peaches with the gorgonzola (my favorite cheese of all time) was so unappetizing. i didn\\'t even get through half of the salad before i said forget it. my husband ordered the garlic cream fettuccine and added sauteed mushrooms and was upset by this as well. the portion size was really small and it was extremely salty. my sister ordered the barbecue cobb salad which was almost entirely jicama. she barely ate half as well because it was just a giant jicama salad! they skimped on all of the other items in the salad and just pretty much covered some jicama in barbecue dressing. \\n\\nthe pricing at cpk has also become outrageous. it was almost $13 for my salad. for a salad! does anyone else find that wrong? considering the ingredients, my salad should have cost $7, tops! pasta is expensive, pizzas were generally reasonable for awhile but those prices have been raised as well. for such a casual dining place the prices are just exorbitant. the service also sucks. our waitress probably spent two minutes total the entire meal at our table. no refilled waters, no how is everything. she was just rushing around everyone else\\'s table except ours. \\n\\nso we all have made a vow never to return to any cpk. especially the one in the chandler fashion center. before i went vegetarian, i got a lovely surprise one morning after eating here and was graced with food poisoning for two days. that was a great experience. despite other glowing reviews posted about this location, i cannot in good conscience give a good review.\\n\\nvapiano is a european concept italian restaurant with a hybrid operation - somewhere between a sit-down restaurant (but no wait staff), a cafeteria/buffet (lines at various food stations), and a fast foot place (counter service).  vapiano straddles these distinctions with technology.  each customer gets a \"credit card\" to track their purchases then pays upon leaving.  maybe that works better for pizzas and large shared plates, but it is a bit awkward for couples and small groups.  and if you want something else (another drink, dessert, etc.), you have to go re-order at the appropriate counter.  sort of awkward in my opinion.\\n\\nvapiano\\'s concept strongly emphasizes interior design - it even says so on their web page.  and while that is all well and good, two true tests of a restaurant are the quality of the food and the cleanliness of the environment.  vapiano scores moderately well on the food (slightly better than average italian), but falters significantly on cleanliness.\\n\\nafter my food was prepared, i took the tray to a nearby table.  i placed the tray down and noticed there were very small winged insects crawling on the table.  not sure what they were - really small termites or large aphids?  bugs and food - not a good combination!  so i changed table two more times and still there were bugs on the tables.  maybe they were there because of the plants in the restaurant?  i don\\'t know, but since i already had my food, i chose the \"least buggy\" table and finished my meal as quickly as i could.  guess it could be at least as buggy as sitting outside or having a picnic?  the moderate mid-week crowd that was there seemed to not notice this problem.\\n\\nthe last table i selected was along the left-side of the restaurant, where there are long white drapes made of a sort of gauzy material.  the drapes hang down to almost table surface height and the tables are perpendicular to the windows.  well, you can guess what comes next - looking at the drapes, you can easily see that they were absolutely filthy, stained by who-knows-how-many previous meals.  while pasta and marinara sauce can be a bit messy, whoever thought to put white drapes next to a table surface wasn\\'t much of a designer.  a simple solution would have been to rotate the tables 90-degrees so they were parallel with the drapes - harder to stain that way.  another good solution - replace the drapes with clean ones, or remove them altogether!\\n\\nas i left to pay, the hostess asked me how my meal was.  i mentioned the bugs and stains, but she seemed oblivious to this.  had she heard it before?  did she not care?  i paid and left.\\n\\ninsects and a dirty environment are a deadly combination for future success.  this location needs to get its act together - get rid of the tiny little buggers and clean the drapes.\\n\\ni give this vapiano location 3 stars (average) for food, but zero stars for cleanliness. pizza is pure garbage. but what do you expect for $5??? was not \"hot and ready\" when i walked in. this place has gradually gone downhill. tonight was the last straw. we ordered 2 philly cheesesteak sandwiches. the tracker indicated  it was out of the oven at least 15 minutes before the driver headed out. the sandwiches were horrible. the bread was hard, there was very little meat on the sandwich and what was there was leathery and hard. we threw the food out. i have requested a refund but have not heard from the store.\\nsherry weaver\\n#neveragain first off i called and the guy barley spoke any english then i had ordered a pizza and had decided to cancel so 2 minutes later i called and canceled but they still charged my credit card so i called and ask for a refund and they pretty much told me too bad so beware of this and i would suggest romas pizza very good and family owned i realllllllly wanted some minestrone soup!\\nso, we went out to dinner, ordered our drinks and food at the same time (i ordered chicken alfredo w/ soup and my husband order tour of italy w/ salad).\\ngot our drinks shortly after, he forgot to bring lemons for my water (i won\\'t drink my water without lemons). shortly after we got our drinks we brought out the salad and breadsticks, which was great. but, not my soup or lemons!! after the salad and breadsticks are completely gone, out comes our entrees, still no soup! i had to ask for my soup and when i got it, it was horrible. the waiter would disappear and hardly checked on us.\\ni seriously hate going to this location, every time we go the service is horrible!\\ndefinitely will not be returning to this location, i would rather drive 15-20 mins to another location then to have to come back here. ordered delivery for me and the kids. two hours later, our meal arrived. i called to inquire after about an hour. was told that the delivery was on the way. minutes later received a call that it was being fired and would be delivered soon. do you think it was on the house? nope. just got a piece of cheesecake and  20% coupon. not good enough. \\nnow, let\\'s talk food. the meatball \"panini\" was a piece of french bread with a bland/acidic sauce. the meatballs were overcooked and dry. not a pleasant experience. the pizza sauce was also watery and bland. you\\'d think that a place called \"sauce\" would have figured it out by now. not so. no i no why all the fridays have shut down..walked in at 930 pm an the kitchen was closed also was there twice in the last year, food was terrible, didn\\'t pay and walked out..wtf.  maybe take some pointers from applebee\\'s on food quality an service. will never ever go there again..shut it down beer selection is good. burger had no flavor. ordered the peach and prociutto salad. had 3 small pieces of prociutto and they were the un-edible fatty parts (couldn\\'t chew it). told the waitress who said the manager told her it was fat (duh!). service was good.\\n\\nnot worth the $60 bill. too bad was hoping this place would be good. would not take my entertainment book coupons off of my phone, although they obviously signed up for that option since it was offered. wasn\\'t very pleasant when not letting me use it either. work on your customer service and don\\'t offer things that you\\'re not willing to provide if i could give this 0 stars i would.\\ndelivery took an hour. pizza arrived cold and not prepared as ordered. sausage is completely unseasoned pork topping.  gross is the only word i can think of to describe this pizza. save your money. you\\'ll get better pizza from the frozen food aisle at giant eagle. huge disappointement.  food was below average and lacked flavor.  the branzino was overcooked and tasteless.   the bigoli was undercooked and ordinary.   the service was subpar.  the only thing worth while in what we ordered were the brussels sprouts and the \"agrumi e ricotta\". perhaps our expectations were too high...?!?! the service is slow and not very friendly and the pizza tastes store bought. i\\'ve tried to eat here several times with friends. \\nbut it just doesn\\'t seem to do anything for me. \\nthere\\'s a jack in the box across the parking lot with hot food and friendly service. this place sucks! the guy was very nice on the phone taking my order, but then 30 min later, i receive some call from gary saying that they do not deliver to me. thanks for letting me know when i placed my order and gave you my cc# already!!\\ni don\\'t know how the pizza is yet, from other location, because it has yet to arrive. \\nwaste of time horrible food don\\'t waste your money\\n\\nthis is the worse cardboard covered cheese & sauce so called pizza i\\'ve ever had, i haven\\'t had this garbage since grade school cafeteria food, most of the reviews on here rant about what a great place this is how much fun you\\'ll have there. idk where that place is cuz the one i wan in today in east liberty by the home depot was getto beyond belief the food is bad & the people aren\\'t nice & friendly.\\n\\nloudness is an issue there when the lottery area has a sign saying because of back round noise your number may be wrong. not one person there had decent customer service skills i had to ask the girl 3 times to speak up and i have excellent hearing. i ordered a small pizza i got a medium that was greasy on top but the crust was stale. \\n\\ni looked forward to getting some great pizza man this place really disappointed me today. i stopped in at this restaurant for a quick lunch. i have never been here before, but knew it had been here for some time. i asked the male and female counter attendants about their slice pizza and was told $4.99 including drink. they told me the slice was 1/4 of an extra large pizza. i ordered a slice and drink. after about 10 minutes the slice was delivered to me. i instantly asked the server if this was the 1/4 of an extra large pizza. i was told yes. what a disappointment. the slice was mostly outer edge crust that barely done. the rest was a very small triangle. the sauce was sweet tomato-e. the cheese topping was a mix of mozzarella and provolone. the cheese was of poor quality and sparse. there was paper thin pepperoni on top.  it was not worth $1.00 much less $3.99 (without drink). employees did not seem to care. i will not return! we came here for a big group lunch during a weekend wedding in az. i had super high hopes based on what we had been told and how cute it was upon pulling up, but i was unfortunately not impressed. \\n\\nthe atmosphere is cute for sure. it is an order at the counter sort of place but their branding is nice and it doesn\\'t feel like every other place in az. while i do think that\\'s great, it wasn\\'t even close to enough to bring up my review of the food. \\n\\nthe food was not good. and not just mine ... nobody at our whole table particularly enjoyed their meal (and we are talking 10 people eating like 6 different things)? the burgers were under cooked and juicing out bloody burger juice. the veggies on the burgers didn\\'t look or taste fresh. my chicken was super gristly and battered with the blandest batter i\\'ve ever had. the ribs were dry and mediocre. even the kids barely touched theirs? it just wasn\\'t a good experience. i know we sent back two burgers to be cooked longer but with how busy it was and the sorts of issues we were having, the rest wasn\\'t even worth trying to fix. \\n\\nand the thing that made this all even worse is that this place isn\\'t too cheap? if i want to have a crappy burger or chicken i\\'ll go to mcdonald\\'s and spend $5 but just my boyfriend and i paid like $30 something bucks for food that we hated and were literally so hungry we ate another meal at another restaurant about an hour later? you can eat much better for that money.\\n\\ni will say their garlic fries were ok - definitely the best food on the table (which is kinda sad). and the chocolate shake was delicious. after trying mine, two other girls at our table ordered some. so i guess if you just want a shake and fries i recommend it but i travel to az often and i won\\'t be back to this spot. it is a sorry time when a long established restaurant with good food has deteriorated to this point.  i have dined at chicago joe\\'s several times over the past 15 years and it has always been a nice place to go for a solid italian meal.  decided to go there last minute at 5:30 last saturday night.  called to see if there was room for 5 and was told to come on down.  arrived 15 min later and was seated promptly and greeted by a friendly waiter.  we ordered some garlic bread, 5 entrees w/salad and some drinks.  the garlic bread was hot and delicious, salad was plentiful.  we all normally love the garlic dressing but this time found it to lack garlic. on to the entrees, the chicken parm was an overcooked sautéed, tough chicken breast covered in sweet sauce that tasted like it was from a can with a melted piece of cheese on top.  (no breading, no seasoning, no flavor), the chicken marsala was topped with a plentiful amount of mushrooms but the sauce was thin, watery and tasted like vinegar.  the linguini with clams was inedible and sent back. lastly, my 12 yr old daughter wouldn\\'t eat the spaghetti with meat sauce as it had no flavor.  as you can see from my reviews we don\\'t normally complain but this honestly was the worst meal we have had. waited over two hours for my order. i called and they told me the order had left the shop and should be delivered any minute. after another 25mins i called back to cancel the order. what really upset me was they made no attempt to apologize and seemed bothered by the fact i called to check on my order. probably wouldn\\'t have been so upset if they wouldn\\'t have charged my credit card. i love antonios pizza but i\\'ll never use this location again. absolutely avoid this place it\\'s a last resort for me and even then i regret it. undercooked pizza sparse toppings and the rudest employee ever. they need to just shut this place down i\\'ve given them so many second chances and will never do it again. when you complain to corporate they send a free pizza for the same location -- how dumb!!! i hope they shut down and something decent fills this prime spot. not so happy hour. my party of 3 arrived around 6:45 last night and were seated around 10 minutes later. our waiter came by a few minutes after 7 and informed us that we couldn\\'t order from the happy hour menu. a few bucks is not going to change my lifestyle but i resent being penalized because a waiter couldn\\'t get to our table. if we were seated during happy hour we should have been allowed to take advantage of it. my wife and i visited east west pizza because we purchased a restaurant.com gift certificate for $2 and we\\'ve been questing to find decent pizza in the area.\\n\\nour meal here was mediocre. we were pleased by the option to have the crust well done (my wife had hers done this way, while i stuck with the regular crust), but the taste was just bland and uninteresting -- totally lacking in the sort of flavour punch that makes a really good pizza.\\n\\ni wasn\\'t going to bother writing a review of the place as pizza is a pretty subjective area, however several months ago i received a spam email from east west -- i must have filled out some comment card or something so, i emailed them and asked them nicely to remove me from their list. they replied, very apologetic, and promised to do so. \\n\\nfor the next several months, despite this guarantee, i continued to receive spam in my email from east west. i emailed them again, this time asking more forcefully to be removed from their list and received no reply - just more spam over the next month or two. tonight i emailed centurylink, their email host, and reported them for spamming.\\n\\neast west pizza - two stars for mediocre pizza that i never feel the need to taste again, minus one star for being spammers. my fiance ordered from here recently. after waiting almost 2 hours for our pizza to arrive, we called and asked what was going on, they said it would be there soon. ten to fifteen minutes later it shows up and the driver informed us that they forgot to make the pizza. any to top it all off we received some cardboard with a thousand dried up pepperoni slices on it. wouldn\\'t recommend i hate dealing with this location, they\\'re slow as hell and rude. every time i place a call for a pickup there\\'s always a 3+ hour wait for pickup and when you go into the actual location for a sit down dinner you\\'ll spend 3 hours waiting to be seated and for your food to arrive. also note the staff isn\\'t as knowledgeable about the menu as some of the other locations so you may find yourself telling them about things on the menu.\\n\\ni questioned them about this long wait and was told it\\'s because they\\'re the only location on the west side....we\\'ll the 10th st & camelback location has been catering to the entire central phoenix area for years with no issues and the manager just looked at me.\\n\\nsave yourself the trouble and call the 10th street & camelback location. i called in for delivery and waited an hour for them to deliver my pizza which yes they might have been busy i understand but when they drop it off i didn\\'t take a look at the pizza because i was working and put it in the back in the break room as soon as i went to go get a slice the entire pizza was burned and it looked old. i waited an hour at least you guys should have made sure my pizza was not burn and at least somewhat fresh. it\\'s so mess up. they wouldn\\'t even give my money back. asked for special with meet. said 12.99 then when i picked up they had a special for 7.99i asked about it and was told \"ya i guess we could of offered you that\" smart ass.  no tip. as i\\'m leaving some smart ass loud mouth women yells \"you have a nice day anyway\" unbearably slow service. i won\\'t return.  food was fine, but there\\'s lots of fine food around; waiting 25 minutes to pay your bill, or 15 minutes to get your water refilled is not a model for a successful restaurant. there seemed to be only one waiter in the entire restaurant for lunch. there was another maybe manager, who was more content to sit down with her laptop and walk around than see how the customers were doing. i do not recommend going to this location what so ever. please drive a little out of your way and avoid this location. absolutely nothing hot n ready. while waiting 20 minutes for two pizzas one pep bestest the other a cheese bestest one would think the pizzas would be hot but they were room temp with no pizza sauce and hardly any cheese. please do not waste your money and time here. i grew up with little caesars and have been to many in different states over the past 15 years and i have never had such a bad experience food wise i have never left a little caesars pizza and thought i was ripped off but this location had me felling like i was ripped off which i was and you will be too. please go to any other location do not waste your time or money at this location. the service is horrible, atmosphere is horrible, coffee is horrible, and everything is overpriced.   i won\\'t be going back. ordered from caliente on a weeknight, and it took an hour and a half to get the pizza.  when we finally got the pizza it was cold.  i was hopeful that after waiting so long the pizza would be worth the wait but was left disappointed.  the toppings were decent but the dough tasted just like the big chains.  \\n\\nbottom line - if you want a passable pizza delivered ice cold in two hours this is your place, otherwise you are better off going somewhere else. in  2 years i\\'ve ordered from here 7 times; once for delivery, 3 times to-go, and 3 times dine in. not only have they never gotten my order right, but the last time my food was spiked with cayenne (which i am allergic too). i had to have an epinephrine shot and still broke out in hives and stopped breathing. if you value your health, please never eat from here this is a new location from the same owners of the luna rossa at lake las vegas.  i have never been to the original location but had a terrible experience today at the downtown/fremont street location. i went with two other people and we ordered the meatball sandwich, filet mignon sandwich and lasagna.  lasagna and meatball sandwich were both cold and flavorless.  am assuming that this was previously frozen and microwaved before it was served to us.  also, the water glasses and silverware were very dirty. we were very shocked when we received our bill... all items that were ordered were supposed to be part of the lunch menu and were supposed to include drinks.  we were charged $3.75 each for our sodas and by that point we all just wanted out of the restaurant. it was really expensive for a previously frozen, microwaved lunch.  the only good part was the krispy kreme donuts that we stopped for on our way back to work. this is one of the worst experiences i\\'ve had at a restaurants. we ordered pizza , salad and a sandwich. after over 45 minutes of patiently waiting and no comment from server in what the delay was, we asked the manger about our food. he said he was too busy to help us. he said he would be with us in 10-15 minutes. if we didn\\'t want to wait, we were more than welcome to leave. who treats customers like that? i told the server we were leaving and left cash for the drinks. she just shrugged her shoulders and said \"do what you have to\". i don\\'t think i gave been treated so poorly as a paying customer in my life. the management is an embarrassment and service, all around was horrendous. what a disappointment. well i thought i would give this place another chance \\nit is obvious that if you come in alone you will be treated like crap .. i had just worked a very long shift at the hospital up the street and in wanted to finely get a bite to eat and use my gift card i had ..\\nwell i was taken to my table and saw my waiter 2 times .. they had not gotten busy till i left .. i dont know maybe i should of told my waiter that even though i am alone i do tip well maybe that would of had him to give me a little bit more time ...\\nit is really sad because i would of never treated him like that if he came into my place of employment.. and i did tip well on a 20.00 bill \\nsad to say i think i am totally done now and i should just give a whole new restaurant a chance to win me over \\nvery sad and disappointed terrible experience overall.\\n\\nservice was so poorly coordinated it ruined our entire dinner, though the staff attempted to be polite. we were seated after being asked to wait for a while (even though half the tables were not taken).\\n\\ni ordered coffee with me dessert, but they didn\\'t serve it until i had finished my dessert (15 minutes after i ordered it). i simply asked them to take the coffee back.\\n\\nseating for two can be very tight and you hear the entire conversation of the table next to us.\\n\\nfood is not bad, definitely overpriced. quality went down. their curry lentil is terrible! it\\'s like curry chicken without the chicken or anything else, just liquid. i called up and apparently it\\'s supposed to be like that. i\\'m sorry but that is not curry lentil. the chicken feta salad is still decent but it is smaller now. i liked the vinaigrette that had seasonings in it and now its just oil and vinegar. i haven\\'t had their pita sandwiches yet. i usually get the chicken feta pita but at this rate i probably will just save my money. the staff was nice and attentive before. the occasional new girl would suck but overall good service. i\\'m not sure about now. haven\\'t ate in yet because their prices are ridiculous! haven\\'t been to pizza hut in a few yrs. my daughter and i wanted to try the bacon crust pizza one day a few wks ago so i ordered online  (ok that wasn\\'t successful so i had to call) anyway i placed my order and 5 mins later they called and said they ran out of the bacon crust. this was at noon. wasn\\'t very happy. needless to say i don\\'t think i\\'ll be attempting this again any time soon i wasn\\'t planning on commenting on quality of food, but since other\\'s have been experiencing the same issues...\\n\\nwe were very excited to move into sun prairie where there was a glass nickel pizza nearby (we previously lived in the milwaukee area).  the day after we moved in, we decided to order glass nickel to eat while unpacking.  the staff was fairly friendly on the phone, pizza came in the delivery estimate time.  pizza itself was okay, but not nearly as good as the new berlin and west madison locations.\\n\\nthe next day, we became violently ill.  with the chaos of moving, their pizza was the only thing i ate all day so i\\'m sure that it was from this.  my husband and i are positive we got food poisoning from their pizza.  we do not plan on re-visiting the sun prairie glass nickel pizza (especially after the reviewer stated that employees were cleaning toilets sans washing hands).  such a shame!! shouldn\\'t even get 1 star! i\\'ve never had such awful customer service and to top that it was by a manager!!????  his name is john? jonathan?? hung up on my without saying goodbye after my order took 20 min past my quoted delivery. pizza is cold, wings cold, salad warm. i asked for a corporate number or a higher up and he said \"find it online\" ! i\\'ve been in the service industry for 16 years and understand things happen, but to not even give an apology or help with the issue is unacceptable! you john are of no significance to a company with the attitude you have. this location will not succeed with management like him. i will find the correct person to contact involving this matter with or without your help. still yucky.  picked up an order which should have been hot, hard as a rock like cardboard and burnt on the bottom.  there are many other places in town for good pizza avoid this and you will be more than happy.  hit and miss place, mostly miss went to a friends birthday dinner at this restaurant. it\\'s a beautiful place but the service was poor. \\n\\nwe arrived 8:30pm on a wednesday, so it wasn\\'t very busy. \\n\\nafter we placed our order, it took 45 mins to get our meals, by that time we were very hungry and he didn\\'t even offer us bread at the table, but everyone else was being served. \\n\\nour waiter spoke little to no english, and i feel like the language barrier was a part of the issue. all he kept saying we \"it\\'s good, it\\'s good.\"\\n\\nsome of us got our dinner, and when my friend asked what kind of meat was on her plate it, he said it was horse meat. \\n\\ni\\'d suggest no one eat here, it\\'s not worth the money and the service sucks. pizza came out cold. we ordered the classic pepperoni and there were probably three slices of pepperoni in the entire pizza. it was just all sauce and cheese. i had an awful experience at rrbc and i will never return again. unfortunately, this was one of my favorite places to go, they have great food and beer. yesterday i was there on a sunday afternoon. the cavs were about to play and i was excited about kyrie returning. i asked the bartender if they could switch one of the tv\\'s to show the cavs games. all the tv\\'s were displaying football games. the bartender went back and asked her manager for permission to change the channel. she got the ok, so i decided to stay and ordered food and a beer. not to long after, a few gentlemen were upset that the tv\\'s were switched to the cavs game. they are all wanted to watch the browns game, which had not even started yet. the owner came out yelling asking who wanted to watch the cavs and seemed very upset. i felt extremely uncomfortable. my friend and i were not the only people who requested to watch the cavs game. if it was a problem, i would have just left to another bar with no problem. they made us feel terrible. to top it off, the gentleman next to me was practically screaming in my ear and was in my person space. he then asked if i could move down a seat so a buddy of his could sit with him, and i told him no because the only tv displaying the cavs games was in front of me and i did not want to move and not be able to see the game. i was there first and should not have to move. as soon as i said no the man got upset and was very rude to me. starting talking bad about me to his friends and called me names. it was just unacceptable. after all that the owner and the older men at the bar kept talking crap about us wanting to watch the cavs vs the browns. last time i checked the cavs is a winning team and the browns are not. i love cleveland sports and if there was not a cavs game on, i would have been happy to watch the browns game. as i sat there trying to enjoy my meal, i felt horrible and uncomfortable. i even lost my appetite. like i said this is a great place, but unfortunately, i will no longer give them my business. it may not be much money they lose, but i hope other people read this and decide not to go as well. i feel as though the owner should not have treated us that way. you are there to run a business and make your customers happy, not make them feel like crap. perhaps it had to do with the fact that i am a woman, who knows. again, i will never ever return to this place again. ordered two sandwiches for delivery at 8:30pm. the gentleman on the phone told me one hour.  after 1.5 hrs i called and the person told me it was out for delivery along with 7 other deliveries and it should be there soon.  two hours later...still waiting. gave this place a second try but no good. \\npastas are dry and bland. chicken parm didn\\'t have any cheese. chicken marsala seemed to be made with cream of mushroom. food quality is not great. my husband & i ate here on s saturday night. we wanted to bowl but there\\'s 1.5 hr waiting list. no big deal, we decided to put a $20 bill into new arcade card and play some games. literally more than half the games would not read the card no matter how slow/fast we swiped or what directions. many of the ones that did read ate our card balance & didn\\'t let us play. we reported it to arcade/projectionist guy  & he made us walk around & relive everything that went wrong. he gave us extra tokens & put $4 on our card. i\\'d rather have $10 back. we were treated like we were trying to score free crappy token gear instead of like customers with an issue. whatever. won\\'t be back. plenty of places to go on saturday night in gilbert besides fat cats. no thanks. i\\'ll happily pass on this place. bad service=bad time. if i had wanted denny\\'s service and denny\\'s food i would have gone to denny\\'s. \\n\\nwhat happened to olive garden??? you used to be regarded with a higher standard now, you are barely one step above fast food!!!\\n\\nwent in around lunch time and the service was so slow.  i ordered and iced tea with lemon and was brought a raspberry tea which i detest.  i told the server right away and i didn\\'t get a replacement until after i had already finished the soup and bread sticks.  mind you she brought the drink before any of the food, and i told her before she brought any of the food.  i didn\\'t get a refill until after a box was brought for my order. pathetic! i love your iced tea and you deprived me of having it. \\n\\nthe food came and i asked for a extra alfredo sauce on my chicken alfredo. i didn\\'t get it, so i asked for it on the side.  10 minutes later she brought it and it was the smallest cup of nothing i have ever seen in my life, not even a full cup of nothing!  my order came with the buy one take one and i got the 3 cheese zitti to go.  when i got home to eat it, it was do disgusting it went straight to the dog.  my daughter ordered the lunch lasagna and the portion size she received was that equivalent to a fancy feast dinner you would feed you cat. you all know which dinners i am talking about.  \\n\\ni am done with olive garden.  macaroni grill here comes our lifetime business.  you have great iced tea, and alfredo too. \\n\\ni did something i don\\'t normally do, and i didn\\'t leave a tip.  you don\\'t go to a sit down location and not expect a drink. did the online order. arrive at the time that the food was supposed to be ready. 10 minutes after i\\'m told it will be a little longer, i\\'m told that the wings are going to be another 12 minutes!!!  wtf?!?  so now i\\'m sitting here in the store for about 30 additional minutes!  i wouldn\\'t have ordered if i knew it was gonna be this long for one pizza and a few wings. nobody wants to sit in your shack for 30 minutes when you\\'ve already been told that the food will be ready when you arrive. the question i have now is how cold is the pizza gonna be when i get home. i want a nice fresh, hot pizza. not something that\\'s been sitting for 30 f-ing minutes!!! possible the worst food i every took a bite of, yes a bite because that was all i could taste. i regrettable had the meatball sandwich which wasn\\'t a sandwich, it was a calzone. i call to tell them the sandwich was wrong, but that\\'s how they make it. got other items wrong on order also. wouldn\\'t feed that garbage to my dog. the best thing about our visit was our waitress. she was attentive and apologetic that the pizza was terrible. it was undercooked, the crust was soggy and the toppings were sparse. too bad. it was the first time we have been out in the evening in 4 months.what a disappointment!  we won\\'t be returning. waited on hold for 38 mins while i listened to a woman bartender complain about everything in her life! she answered, and told me to hold. she never came back to the phone?? what a joke!!! girl was kind enough to tell me that i always don\\'t tip when i purchase my pizza to go.  i\\'ve been a server/host for 5 years so i guess i don\\'t know a thing about tipping? i guess it takes real skill to put my pizza on a plate and ring me out at the register? i mean if she was my waitress of course i would tip her. i don\\'t think i\\'m going to feel comfortable purchasing a pizza here again... we \"used\" to order the family special every week or two on a regular basis. food was decent & value for the $ (at that time) was fairly good too. one night we ordered, the food was delivered. we paid cash & tipped well (always do, as i used to deliver fast food myself). we get a telephone call the next day saying that we shorted the driver $10. wtf? seriously? like the driver would not know this right at the door (if it were true)? we do not get a call that night (we ordered for dinnertime) but the next day! clearly they got ripped off by their driver. we have not ever ordered from there again. brampton\\'s best pizza(s)..mackay & gusto\\'s. i was excited to try a new pizza place so close to my house.  i should have saved my money. person on the phone and at the shop was very nice, so it\\'s doubly disappointing to give them a bad review.\\n\\nbottom line, our pizza was over-cooked. we could tell when we opened the box.  the crust was dark brown, as was the cheese.  on one pizza the bottom of the crust was burned black and we could not eat it. the other was not as burned, but was so overcooked it was not enjoyable.  \\n\\nwhoever cooked this pizza should have known the second it came out of the oven that it was ruined.  i would have preferred them being honest and asking me to wait an extra 10 minutes to make another instead of passing off something they had screwed up.  sure they saved a little money that night, but they lost the lifetime value of me as a customer.  that hundreds of dollars lost as well as me not telling people to avoid going there.\\n\\nit such a hassle to get home to discover the problem.  do i call and complain? do i have them make another requiring another trip and eating at 9:00 pm? \\n\\nwe also ordered 6 buffalo wings which were good.  good meat and tangy sauce.\\n\\nfinally, i was also disappointed in the quantity of pizza toppings.  i ordered pepperoni and mushroom and there was maybe one mushroom per slice, some had none.\\n\\ni really wanted to like this place, especially because i like thin crust pizza, but we are one and done. we won\\'t be going back. these guys are assholes and the place is filthy.  i\\'d rather eat frozen ellio\\'s out of the box terrible, terrible, terrible. let me say first that we didn\\'t get the deep dish, i didn\\'t realize that is what they were famous for. also the staff were nice, not overly helpful but never rude. my daughter got their wings, super fatty (probably tyson). there was a long blonde hair in it, she has dark brown hair. when we told our waiter he said ok then took the plate, no apology. they did bring her out new ones but like i said before they were to fatty to enjoy. they did not even offer to take them off our bill. our thin crust pizza taste like it literally came from a box. i can\\'t even remember the last time i have had thin pizza this bad!! the ice cream cookie had generic tasting ice cream and i believe it was covered in the store bought hershey\\'s syrup. i have never written a bad review about a restaurant, only good ones. nothing has ever been that disappointing that i felt the need to write one until now. my wife ate here a few hours ago. she now has the worst case of food poisoning. we will never eat here again! these people are below average intelligence \\ntry to rip you off \\nargue with you about specials posted on the menu board in the store!\\nhad enough of them i do not have the time to teach basic common sense !\\nthe special reads add any pizza for 9.95\\n(equal or lesser value )\\ni order a pepperoni and sausage and a specialty pizza.\\nsimple right well they say they can\\'t honor the \"2nd\" pizza because it\\'s a \"specialty\"\\nwhat does it matter what order i say my pizza\\'s in?\\nis it the darn important that you have to say the specialty pizza 1st? common sense would be to just charge for the specialty pizza the charge me for the pepperoni and sausage at 9.95 right?\\nwell if i have to teach them basic common sense and argue over it i will just find me a new shop! mediocre and uninspired dishes made only worse by the size of the portions and high price tag, should rank woods as your top 10 to skip while in toronto. my first yellowfin tuna was served so well-done that it no longer resembled fish; how this even left the kitchen is beyond me, as they seemed to think i was crazy for not liking it this way. the second attempt, while cooked properly, had zero flavour and the sides (poignantly touted on the menu) were no where to be found. i paid $30 for two meagre slices of tuna that could have been a sashimi appetizer at your local sushi joint. \\n\\nmy girlfriend got served cod despite ordering duck, and aside from the over cooked duck breast she eventually received, her plate was bare aside from a few butter drenched croutons. \\n\\nhighly disappointing and ridiculously overpriced for pub fare. so, we came here a few years ago and had a bad experience with the service and the food. fast forward to 2012 - we decided to give the grill another try - it was good. we continued to patronize the grill and even told friends that we enjoyed it!  huh, what a huge mistake! we went with our neighbors who were very reluctant but were willing to try again. to say it was a disaster is being kind. the manager mike (yes you mike) was a total jerk. we waited a good hour for our food and my husband who ordered a sirloin burger, got his order without the burger!  what a total joke this place is! the manager mike (yes you mike) is a first class worthless idiot!  \\nthere are plenty if other good places that would be delighted to have our business!  \\ni felt sorry for the waitress who had to put up with pathetic mike (yes you mike)!\\ndo yourself a favor and patronize somewhere other than the grill. very mediocre pizza. if you\\'re stranded in the brothers parking lot with a broken down car and you\\'re really hungry, you\\'d be better off walking to the circle k and getting a snack to tide you over til help arrives. to everyone who gave it lots of stars, you need to get out more and live a little...and eat better pizza. i\\'ll start by saying that my boyfriend and i have been to many pt\\'s in the city and they have all been pretty awesome. we were enjoying this location until we were slapped with a bill without even asking for it and the bartender saying \"here\\'s what you guys owe, just so you know.\" we were no where close to finished and came here to enjoy an evening together to get some snacks and to play some keno. we collectively put about $500+ through the machines and we were charged for mostly all of our drinks.\\n\\nwe\\'re not ones to ask for free items ever as we are both in the service industry and understand they have to make money as well (in which we always make sure to take care of our bartenders very well because we go off the original amount of the bill) but as a local you know it\\'s typically customary for drinks to be comped, especially when playing the machines. (which we played for roughly 5-6 hours for the entire duration of the time we were here.)\\n\\nhe left and incredibly bad taste in our mouth after this action of his and we found this to be incredibly rude. \\n\\nafter years of loyalty to the company, many long nights, many football games and thousands of dollars played through the machines we\\'re just disappointed. i hope that things will be improved in the future. \\n\\nsadly, we probably will not be visiting this location again. horrible i went there tonight! waited in drive thru for about 10-15 minutes .\\nordered 2 orders of mash potatoes and gravy and 6 biscuits....\\ni asked if everything was in the bag and honey and butter she said oh i got you.\\n\\nneedless to say i spend 12 bucks on 6 biscuits one thing of potatoes and gravy. \\n\\ncalled to tell me he fumbled with the phone then questioned someone because i wanted to talk to a manager. then said oh i\\'ll put them on hold, told me they would be with me in a minute . i waited 5 because they never put me on hold just put phone down.\\n\\nthe line has been busy for 26 minutes to call back the most disgusting pizza i have ever eaten.  nothing but salt and no cheese.  ugh...will never order from them again! twice i have ordered the asian chicken salad with mango and twice they have given me a salad without mango. it\\'s the main ingredient!\\ni emailed to let them know thinking it might be a mistake but they never bothered to respond.\\n\\nterrible service & food not as advertised.\\n\\ndont bother we ordered this monday night after a busy work day. generally a fail safe, as you know what you\\'re going to get. not this time. i got my own pan pizza, which saved my boyfriend who got his own pizza, from being violently ill for 3 days. im still feeling the stomach pain, although not the terrible twisting of death i was the days before. i phoned to inform them of what happened and of course, just as i thought, the person i spoke too did not care or say anything worth anything. i explained how i didn\\'t want anything, just that they should probably know. they proceeded to tell me that i would need to see a doctor to prove what happened. i honestly do not care nearly enough to pay $10 for a doctors note to prove this. i am just warning other people that this was by far the most painful sick i have ever been in my life. violently awful and lasted for days now. please beware... ordered 5 pizzas at 11 for 11:45 pickup confirmed waiting for 25 minutes and pizza still not ready. \\ngot an \"oh sorry\".  \\n\\ni watched 5 customers leave.  one said, \" let\\'s go for office max we stand a better chance of getting food.\" horrible no decor it feels like a big warehouse the bartenders were drunk and more interested in throwing ice at the nice tvs and down girls tops then waiting on the only 2 people gambling. second time there and last time there. every once in a while i love to remind myself as to why i don\\'t order delivery from chain pizza places like domino\\'s, pizza hut, papa john\\'s, etc. sometimes i\\'m pleasantly surprised and tonight i was not. \\n\\nover an hour and a half delivery time and i received a soggy medium pan pizza. but what had me most concerned is that my pizza was pulled out of the oven and checked at 6:35ish and was sitting there for over 45 min before it left the store. \\n\\nafter delivery fees and tips for $16 i recommend eating a frozen pizza because at least you can pull it out when it\\'s actually done baking. me, didn\\'t have access to an oven. otherwise i know what i would\\'ve done. baked a pizza. i\\'ve ordered from here several times, and every single time they\\'ve gotten the order wrong and tonight they also forgot to deliver the liter of pepsi. we called and asked for the pepsi we paid for, and they said they can\\'t deliver one tonight but next time we\\'d receive a free pepsi. i said it\\'s not free because we paid for one and didn\\'t receive it and they didn\\'t understand. don\\'t ever order from here! 2.5 hours, multiple phone calls, 30 plus minutes on hold. no food. promise of a managers call tomorrow and as of now a supposed refund. absolutely unbelievable, also let the record show that the business number goes to \"call center\". i\\'m a very understanding customer but this went to a very unacceptable level. uggg!!!!cant get the order straight when i called they were not listening to the complaint proceeded to ask me what i wanted to order then i asked him to stop talking and listen well what do you think happened next,,,you got it the ole\\' hold button aaahahaa then the gal whom took my order got on the phone and told me she would make another..no thanks it wouldn\\'t have been so bad but they were not busy and i did repeat the order several times johnny vegas grill has some of the best food that i have found locally since relocating to the vegas area a little over a year ago. unfortunately, i will no longer be doing any business with the establishment. today i placed an order for delivery at which point the representative taking my order advised the food would arrive in around 25 minutes. the food arrived just short of an hour and a half, and to my disappointment, the food was soggy and cold. i have always received great service from johnny\\'s, so i decided to reach out to the general manager to inquire about a possible refund. after explaining the situation and politely requesting a refund, the general manager quite unprofessionally told me that an hour and a half wait time isn\\'t anything uncommon, and that i was being \" ungrateful for how accommodating she is\". as i expressed, johnny vegas grill has delicious food.. it is very unfortunate that they have a general manager representing the business at a lesser quality than the quality of food they provide. the pizza gods have blessed us today.   thank you for closing down!  \\n\\n\\none and done.  tried it once and never went back.    if i could give zero stars, i would have definitely given what was deserved. servers can\\'t tell a real driver\\'s licence from a fake one. refused service for my daughter who is of legal age to drink and bluntly embrassed her by telling her the id was fake. she tried to show that the birthdate on her government health card was the same (she knows a health card\\'s can\\'t be used as id).  eventually, the server spoke to a manager and offered to serve, but without compensation for the embarrasment. a free dessert, discount.  they need to be smart serve certified to understand how to determine real id from fake. maybe, asking for another piece of id as well to confirm the legitimacy of the birthdate. food is overpriced. i ordered that pomodoro and honestly i cant tell you it was pretty horrible the meatballs were very overcooked and dry, the sauce was incredibly bland and the portion size was like 2 bites. the only half way decent thing was the actual past itself which was average. for just under $11 definitely not worth it i wouldn\\'t have paid $5 for this. my dinner cost me over $800.00 \\n\\nhad dinner there food was good but i bit down on a rock in my salad from the salad not being washed properly and broke a tooth.  \\n\\ni brought it to the manager and he gave me his card, i called and called.  they ignored me.  so i paid out of pocket to get my dental work.\\n\\ni will never return\\n\\nif you want dirty salad then you have dinner there\\n\\nmanager not honest said owner will help\\nowner will not accept responsibility \\nproduce not being properly prepared the pizza was burn over cooked. we eat three slices and make up no taste to it. would not recommend this place for their pizza. at the end we asked for a box, the staff make us a small container for more than a half of a pizza. not even a pizza box . checked in here last week to get a brew and bite while kids next door at force center. i am at the force a lot as i coach and play there. would love for the brew co to work out but the service again was awful. i sat at the bar and had to yell after sitting there for 5 minutes without being greeted.  \\nat least say hi be with you in a minute as you walk by 7 times. literally i sat at the beer taps so i patiently waited before i said something. then after finally getting a beer. atasty ipa which was not theirs as they had no ipas. what decent brewmaster has no ipas??\\n\\nmy wife came in anxious for a beer and some food. after sitting there another 7 minutes she said nice service and walked out. \\n\\ndone done done with this place. this was one bad sandwich and not really an italian deli at all. they have a motto saying that they have \"the biggest and best sandwiches\", but what you get is exactly the opposite. the menu listed nothing italian like ziti, etc - it is just  a sandwich shop and not a good one at that. first problem on this saturday was the cashier girl, who was new and did not know the answers to any questions we asked about the food. who trained this individual? the next issue was the sandwich itself, but these 8 buck wedge sandwiches are small, constructed poorly and somehow, the condiments of mayo, lettuce and tomato caused me alot of gas only 45 minutes later. this deli is a joke, not worth the money or the hype. the meat is boars head, but beyond that, some chains have better sandwiches than this place. have been waiting 29 minutes past when my online order was supposed be ready. there\\'s 3 others in the entire place so i don\\'t think they could be backed up. have encountered this many times before, very frustrating!! we found this place several years ago and had some family with us. we ordered pizza, salad and garlic knots. everything was so delicious. we visted a few more times over the next few years and everything was so very good. last night proved it will be the last time. a 16\\' pizza is now $20 or more. all the prices went up and we were told it is because of the minimum wage hike. they only have one size pizza. we ordered garlic knots they were not hot at all and sent them back. we asked for our pizza to be a little crispy and half of it ended up being burnt. we have always asked to be a little crispy and it always came out so good, not this time.  ordered 6 wings $6.50 for 6 wings\\n they were very good. we asked for 1 ranch dressing to dip our pizza crust in. we got charged .60c for a souffle cup. nope that was it. so very dissatisfied overall. service was mediocre. guess all customers will have to pay for the minimum wage hike, tipping no longer needed. when i got home to eat my pizza it barely had any cheese, banana peppers and pepperoni. next time i\\'ll pay the extra fee for more toppings, if i ever from here again. we had done a reservation and no one ever told us that the main street to get to the restaurant was closed for a parade. drove 45 minutes just to be told by a police officer at a barricade that the road was inaccessible and we needed to park our vehicle 2 kilometers away if we wanted to get to our destination. tried calling the restaurant but no one ever picked up the call. some 30 minutes later, on our way back home, some lady called to ask if we were still planing on showing up. i explained what had happened and she didn\\'t bother doing or proposing anything because of their mistake. bad customer service. shame on you people. no sense of business relationships. \\n\\nnever again!!! the last time we ordered from this place is took an hour and a half to get our food. we decided to give it another try, we ordered tonight, they said it would be 45 mins-1 hour. three hours later we call them ( for a second time) and they say the pizza is still at the restaurant, \"we got busy, we can\\'t help it\". i can understand getting busy, but why would anybody even want a pizza that\\'s been sitting there for more than 2 hrs?! and we\\'re less than 5 miles down durango from them. the food is decent, but we won\\'t be ordering from them again. don\\'t waste your time. been here twice, and haven\\'t gotten to eat anything.\\n\\nfirst time was on an already hot summer day, for brunch, and where we were seated had hot air blowing on us (likely from the open kitchen). add to that, the lackluster menu, we decided to leave.\\n\\ntried again yesterday for lunch, and after waiting at our table for 10-15 minutes, we were never approached by a server (although they were at the table next to us at one point). there were only 2 other tables, so they weren\\'t busy. obliviously we left. ironically, as we left, the guy behind a counter thanked us for our business.\\n\\nonly restaurant i have ever walked out of. \\nand twice!\\n\\ndisappointed, because i love most of the restaurants in my neighbourhood (ronces), and had heard great things about this place. the staff was super nice and delivery was quick. however for three large pizzas it was over $72. the pizzas were plain with no flavor. looked beautiful but zero spice funny my burger didn\\'t look like the add pics it was bright red inside. scary for a hamburger. will not be going back,and the line to order is slower than disneyland. i was there for a birthday celebration, which celebrated three people, last sunday,  march 13, 2016. after waiting for an hour and never receiving any service, i decided to leave. i was later told by my friend that there was only one server on duty for over 50 people. i understand watching your bottom line, but this was ridiculous. my first and last time at this establishment! if i had to rate this place on pizza alone, this review would be a lot different.\\n\\nfirst of all, i have had a $5 off an order of $20 or more coupon for.. well, i can\\'t even tell you how long. every time i call to place an order, they give me some new bs excuse as to why i can\\'t use my coupon. (\"oh, we already ran your card\" which, well, why the fuccccccc would you do that? and i\\'m sure if i wanted to add something to my order, that would be justtttt fine. or \"well, the you can\\'t use that with the family deal,\" in which case, why the heck isn\\'t that written on the coupon? that\\'s really something that should be in the fine print.)\\n\\nthen tonight, my family in from out of state decides on pizza and wings... and regardless of the stupidity of their employees (\"well, the family deal does come with two two liters,\" \"uh, no it doesn\\'t... it comes with one...\" \"welll i am looking at it right here and it says two liters.\" really? yes. one bottle is two liters. derrrrrrp.) their pizza happens to be some of my fave. so we order pizza and wings, and we ask for medium wings with extra wing hot sauce on the side. instead, we get a vat of ranch and wings that are dryer than betty white\\'s.... well, yanno. so my family and i just ordered gyros. worst meal we have ever had!!!!!!  we call  to inform the manager and all he did was argue with us that he has the best gyros in town. worst food, the salad was even bad. will never order from here again, not only because the food was bad but so was the customer service from the manager!! poor service. terrible food. soggy and undercooked, no understanding of the problem. \\ntook 30 minutes to get an undercooked pizza. had our money refunded the food was so terrible. such a shame! i have ordered food here a few times and it\\'s been fine.  nothing great but okay and near my home.  tonight...i\\'m making myself eat some of it just so i\\'m not hungry.  totally disgusting. sampler platter,  fries cold and mushy, came  with no sauce, chicken wings cold and mushy.  chicken fingers - one not cooked all the wayand the rest mush. the soup was beef vegetable.  something from out of a can.   sub sandwich - vinegar completely soaked through bread and mushy.  i almost cannot believe that they serve food like this.   i would attribute a lot of this to the fact that i ordered it at 6:35 and it arrived at my house at 7:45.  the way it tastes - it sat for at least 45 minutes getting cold and mushy.   i will never order from this restaurant again and i suggest that you don\\'t either.  with this economy, one would think that places that want to stay in business would go the extra distance to make sure their food is better.   by the way, sandwich, soup, 5 chicken strips and sampler appetizer $$43 with the $5 tip that i wish i hadn\\'t had given now.  i feel completely ripped off and still hungry....  if you aren\\'t good at the other things on the menu, why are you serving them and delivering them??? a friend and i went to this restaurant several weeks ago. at the end of the meal, the server whose name i won\\'t mention (sheryl), came to us with the check. mind you, we still had glasses of wine on the table that we hadn\\'t finished. she hands my friend the bill and my friend handed her her credit card. the server said (not nicely), \"i need two credit cards.\" my friend told her that i would be paying cash. instead of leaving the check on the table and saying something such as \"enjoy your wine and i will be back for the check,\" she stood at the table while i opened my wallet to get the money and stared at me until i came up with the money. she would not leave the table. my friend and i are in our 60\\'s, by the way. i had to come up with the money and figure out the tip while she hovered over the table. afterward, i sent a letter to the restaurant manager explaining the situation to him or her and never heard a word back. i will never go to stella mia again and plan to tell everyone i know about this disrespectful, unprofessional behavior. i used to love this place, i am wondering if it has been taken over by new management...  i order three entrees. i received two both with the wrong sides and one cooked wrong. sent it back recooked wrong again asked if the would take off the side that i never received they argued then finally did it.  i am really hoping this is just an off night for them but if i am going home hungry they get one star. totally ovarated, nice ambiance. but food is not good. spaghetti carbonara were soaking in sauce, very salty. that was my second time, won\\'t go back. out of 7 of us, only one was ok with quality of the food. zach bruell has to rethink his cuisine. \\nvery disappointed visited this place on november 19th 2016, which is national adoption day, and the service was horrible. the cashier that helped me was okay, but i got her to open up and become more customer friendly. we had roughly 20 people with us as an adoption was finalized and we went there to celebrate. as we had been sitting there possibly 15 to 20 minutes, a woman is all black with dyed blond hair came and placed reserved signs on the tables we we occupied and told us that we didn\\'t have to move just yet. at that time it was 1:40 pm and the reservation was for 2 pm and we haven\\'t even received our food at the time. the food came out sporadically as we\\'d get chicken wings, then bread-sticks and pizza last. this place is going downhill and could be saved if the employees were more courteous to the customers as this is a consumer based business. went here with the office for our annual party and i expected decent food. we went with the party menu which was set with shared apps and a choice of 4 different mains. \\n\\nfrom the time we sat down, our server at the bar appeared frazzled and took forever to get drinks set,made and served.  i tried the italian greyhound for my first drink, not only did it take 30 minutes to get to me, it came with 4 extra fruit flies on it.\\n\\ni twitted about it and was asked to dm so that they could speak to the management about it.\\n\\nafter about an hour or so of waiting for all of our coworkers to get there, we then headed downstairs into the private room which i have to say have one of the coolest decor/ambiance i have been in.\\n\\nthey started to serve the palenta fries which was shared between everyone.  it was alright, bland and the marinara dip tasted like something you could get from loblaws.\\n\\nthe second starter they served was the pizza.  the crust was good, but if you eat the pizza with the toppings you will be met with the saltiest things ever.  so... needless to stay, i just ate the crust.\\n\\nthe third starter was a platter of mini meatballs, tiger shrimps and the risotto balls which was basically an upscale cafeteria food.  \\n\\nfor an italian place, the meatballs tasted like a frozen dinner meatloaf rolled up into little balls.  \\n\\nnext served was the salad and the tomato and cheese appetizer.  these 2 i believe was the only ones i was able to eat with no problem although i think the salt that tomato/cheese app needed all was put into the pizza.\\n\\nthe mixed mushroom appetizer came next and was ok.  it seemed fresh and was nice.\\n\\nfor the main, i chose the fettucine, which came with shrimps, pesto, mascarpone cheese and a touch of tomato sauce.\\n\\ni won\\'t hold back on my review because honestly, for an upscale place, i was hoping to be blown away.  the pasta was way overdone, there was a mixture of frozen package shrimps and the tiger shrimps so the cook on both were totally off.  i think that i would have had a better tasting pasta from the cooked food section of a loblaws. i could not, for the love of god eat more than a bite full of this \"italian pasta\".\\n\\nthe chef\\'s selection of deserts however was good.  i think aside from the deserts, decor and the people i was with, nothing else was good.  \\n\\nat the end of the night, i had to go grab dinner at sushi inn just so that i could have a proper dinner.\\n\\nunfortunately, coming here with expectations and only being underwhelmed was a very big disappointment to me and my friends.  i would hope that in the future, they taste their food prior to serving them to their patrons.\\n\\nfood score:\\npalenta fries: 2/5\\npizza: 0.5/5\\npolpettine/mini meatballs: 0/5\\narancini/risotto balls: 1/5\\nshrimp diavola:

hand not so much.  sausage, mushroom and cheese  calzone large.. very large, wish i could have tasted the sausage.  that didn\\'t sound good.  creme brûlée burnt sugar, the creme was soup vs solid.  the bottle of wine couldn\\'t even make this meal work. absolute garbage. 0 stars. flies crawling all over the slices. smells gross. pizza barely had any tomato sauce. pepperonis were like the ones from a lunchable. cheese is plastic crap. i\\'m royally pissed off & papa ceo would be too!!!!!! gross! we ordered a pizza for delivery, and waited 2 and a half hours with no delivery. called and the manager said they overlooked the order, we asked for a full refund and they gave us $10 off.  delivery guy finally showed up and we had already ordered chinese.  horrible customer service.  if the pizza is over 2 hours late, give it for free.  better yet, never order from a pizza place that takes 2 hours to deliver!!! the linguine di mare i ordered for takeout was missing it\\'s lobster had lunch with work colleagues today and the eggplant parmigiana was the worst ever! i swear to god, the thickness of the eggplant was 1 mm i repeat 1 mim!! can\\'t even fathom how someone could create such a ridiculously thin slices and then have the nerve to serve it and then call it eggplant parmigiana! the layers were 95% floured coating then heavily deep fried - never order that. next time i crave eggplant parmigiana, i\\'ll just get the costco,\\'s frozen version - so much better! the  accompanying sad garlic bread clearly tasted stale! the restaurant is just riding on its reputation- cannot imagine how. ok so they charge a lot just for a single slice of pizza but what gets me is they charge a lot for what looks like old pizza that they reheat just to give to you which is one messed up and two gross i recommend going to paris casino and go to la pizza same price but man is it worth it the pizza at that place was amazing definitely worth the walk and and use your money for better food! worse experience ever!!!!! and i\\'m from the east coast!!! i would never treat anyone how the 2 people the young lady and guy working treated me . i wanted to like this place sooo bad i walk in i got totally ignored! not only did the hostess young lady ignore me she didn\\'t even say hello welcome to such and such nor did the other guy . did ask if i had any questions she found tons of stuff to do while i  waited for just her to notice me . extremely rude i\\'m the kind of person that when i find a good east coast place i tell my east coast friends but that will never happen extremely rude and i will never return and tell everyone to not go to your establishment !!!! find better staff that don\\'t mind being social with every race ! free crazy bed my a** lol. blonde girl made some bull excuse. saying we had to of just ordered. we\\'ve been here for four minutes lol and noticed the sign. so don\\'t bother asking for free bread sticks that their sign specified \"if we don\\'t offer you a crazy combo ... it\\'s free\" lies what went wrong is the service. we called for a delivery of 2 pizzas at 19h30 on a tuesday night since the weather was terrible outside, even if we live 10 minutes walk away. an hour later, we receive a call saying that our pizzas were missing with their delivery person. so it\\'s either we wait for the delivery to show up (after already waiting for an hour) or we pick it up ourselves. we were shocked to find this out an hour after our order, when we were specifically told there was a 30 minute wait before getting our pizzas, which we accepted. this is very disapointing for the fact we needed to walk in the terrible weather to pick them up, getting them more than an hour and a half later.... delivery:the crust was soggy,the box was full of a liquid  every slice fell apart,the salad was a joke i weighed it and it was only 3 ozs,what a rip off don\\'t waste your $ on this dump. a group of us from work spent $10 on a groupon and went for lunch.  the waitress was extremely upset that we had groupons and cursed at one of us when she found out we were using them. after she scanned all our vouchers she tells us that we are losing the remaining amounts left on the voucher. if we knew that before hand we all wouldnt have used our vouchers at once.  overall terrible experience.  she should have educated us about how to make the most of the groupon rather than getting upset and cursing. i\\'ve never been so appalled with service in my entire life. \\n\\nthe food was approrpriately priced for lunch and was pretty good. if it wasn\\'t for the terrible service we would be back again. we really wanted to like this place!! we love ground control in litchfield and we were so excited that a new pub-style place was opening in surprise. unfortunately this didn\\'t live up to the hype. \\n\\nwe had to wait about 20 minutes for a table (even though we saw open tables) and then were seated in the noisy bar in a very strange table. we asked to be moved and you\\'d think we asked to move to the moon. they put us near the pizza area, the only people seated there (which was weird). we ordered beer, pretzels and cheese, and a burger to share. the \"beer cheese\" was really bad. it tasted like it came from a jar...they need to try the mellow mushroom beer cheese!! the burger was small and bland, fries were greasy. with two beers and the small burger, it was over $60!! what a waste. we won\\'t be back. great childhood memories but absolutely horrible pizza & customer service tuesday night! if i could leave no stars i would. both our pies had no cheese or at least not enough to be considered pizza. when we called to complain the young man did not want to hear it & firmly stated all ingredients are weighed out period. left my name & # for the manager/owner to call me (because he was too busy) and still have received nothing. i will never go back the salmon was burnt and the manager was rude. my family will never go back. there are too many good restaurants around this area. the service was super slow. they had maybe 5 people inside and another 15 outside and we had to wait close to an hour for our pizza we never got. wouldn\\'t suggest if you\\'re hungry. i love pizza 73s pizza. but this place uses the same spatula to spread the sauces on the pizza. many times when ordering a creamy garlic based sauce because i have a tomato allergy. i have found tomato sauce mixed in with the creamy garlic. not impressed this was the worst pizza i have ever had. the cheese and sauce had both a sour taste and smell. the crust was bland and hard. the price was right at $3.99 so i gave it a try instead of going to a pizza franchise...but it was too horrible to eat. ordered the pizza on my phone. it said it would be ready in 10-15 minutes. went to pick it up. worker looked up the order on the computer and said it wasn\\'t ready yet. didn\\'t get the pizza until more than 40 minutes after we ordered it! brought it home (5 minute drive) and guess what - the pizza isn\\'t even hot anymore!!! i\\'m guessing the pizza was made on time but the order wasn\\'t updated in the system? i don\\'t know. but either way - waiting 40 minutes for a cold pizza is totally unacceptable. i\\'ve been to other locations and this has never been a problem. after waiting almost a decade to share my favorite pizza with my parents i now know i should have kept waiting.   i expected a bit of a line but i was rushed through checking and they were onto the next customer before my family could ask about pre ordering.  luckily a while later we heard some one else pre ordering so we did it too being told to pre order our deep dishes only.   45 minutes after ordering we were seated , just a few minutes late.   \\n\\nwe ordered appetizers since they quoted an hour and a half for deep dishes.  and ordered a child\\'s pizza and my father who loves pizza ordered his favorite pizza pepperoni asking the waiter which pizza he could order to be out no later than our deep dishes. he got a thin crust. \\n\\nour deep dishes didn\\'t come out until we had been seated for over an hour, it took almost another hour for the kids menu pizza and the thin crust. we were there over 3 hours.  oh and to top it off when the final pizza arrived it had no pepperoni on it.  instead covered in olives which he hates.   \\n\\ni regret going there and feel embarrassed at telling them years how much i love this place. the servers were scrambling the whole place was behind while a non stop of carry outs and delivery were being paraded out the door.  save yourself the trouble of relying on their service. just get a delivery if you must eat their food or better yet get a frozen one mailed from chicago as this place doesn\\'t deserve your money until they can meet the expectations they set. \\n\\n\"we swear 10 more minutes max and it\\'s out\" waited another 20. \\n\\nthis place doesn\\'t deserve to wear the name. every large university area i have been to seems to have a hot dog shop near it. some are great others are not, but one this is true is that they all offer cheap eats. in this case we have an oddity, a fairly expensive hot dog stand offering poor food.\\n\\nok i know this place is an iconic pittsburgh institution but the food is sorely lacking. first of all if you want a dog or two and some fires you have to stand in two different lines, so either you dogs get cold or your fries get gold while you are waiting for the other. lame.\\n\\nsecond complaint the dogs are cooked on a griddle where they sit and sit and sit drying out, my idea of a hot dog is not a semi-blackened piece of jerky meat, it should he juicy and succulent. it\\'s too bad that they ruin their dogs this way, getting past the dried out part the taste of this dog would have been pretty good if prepared correctly\\n\\nthird complaint the buns - what is with east coast people and their feeble wonder bread buns they serve hot dogs on? you have two main components: the dog and the bun, both of these should be of high quality if you skimp on either one you will have a sub-par hot dog.\\n\\nfourth complaint - complete and utter disorganization of ordering, waiting and paying for your dog. you would think that some genius would be able to how to figure out and streamline the process to make it more efficient. also hire some employees with some personality the three that were there seemed to hate their jobs.\\n\\nfifth complaint - $ 7.75 for two regular dogs (this was a special too) and a drink is ridiculous, throw in fries and i\\'m over $10 bucks - that\\'s highway robbery for what was served.\\n\\nfood 1.5 stars - it\\'s hard to screw up a hot dog but they did it\\nservice 1.5 stars - i think if anybody smiled their face would have fallen off.\\nvalue 1 star, ok i have to give at least 1 star according to yelp otherwise this would be zero.\\n\\ntotal: 1.33 stars\\n\\nfor hot dogs in pa both the frantuary (2 stars) has won in the toppings contest while wiener world (3 stars) has the best dogs and buns. i waited for four hours in the blistering cold and asked for crushed red pepper and you still said no... the pizza is pretty shitty man they had no pepperoni pizza he likes it more than i do... i ain\\'t that mad but i just don\\'t like getting diabetes. the customer service was good nothing bad to say .. but the pizza tasted like frozen diabetes with sesame seeds. my grandson and i had the displeasure of ordering from this restaurant. a waste of 32.00 and i tipped the delivery person.  the crust is bland, the fetuccine was like gooey. tasteless italian food should be deemed a crime the salad they serve with the pasta is just a bowl of the same kind of shredded lettuce they put on sandwiches at subway. i ordered the creamy pesto pasta which was pretty good but just barely above average. i also found a what looked like a hair baked into the garlic bread they brought me. they told me it was a bristle from the brush they use to brush the butter on the bread... still gross. i was literally the only person in the whole restaurant as well. the prices were great but the food just isn\\'t. was excited to try location closer to us. went in on non busy weeknight last week. server was very quiet, couldn\\'t hear her and not much of a people person. put in an order for pasta for my hungry daughter with oil and garlic and she brought out plain spaghetti and told me oil and cheese are on the table. 20 mins later i asked if her meatballs were coming out. oh i forgot to put them in. no apology or here let me grab them at no charge. so we just forgot about them. had to ask me what beer my husband ordered again cause he was in bathroom and she forgot. never came around to ask if he wanted another drink but manager finally did. first and second half of pizza came out almost cold. couldn\\'t guess why on that. only two tables of two and one table of 8 at the time. leftover pizza thrown on paper plates and in a brown paper bag with nothing covering them. will not return would rather drive extra distance to scottsdale or just go to pomo downtown gilbert! my experience with maggiano\\'s was terrible. our first impression was of the host, a young man with a very snooty, rude attitude. we were there on a monday night and asked for a table on the patio. his response was \"the server already has 7 tables out there and i\\'m not giving her another\". we had crystal as our server. she was less than pleasant, not smiling or friendly at all throughout the entire meal. i ordered the eggplant parmesan. it was terrible. the eggplant was a mushy mess and the pasta was very underdone.  my honey had the spaghetti with meatballs which neither of us cared for. my daughter had the chicken tenders with mashed potatoes. hers was the best  meal of the three. we will not return to maggiano\\'s and would not recommend this restaurant to others. we were honestly disappointed. when you go to a pizza place you expect at a minimum soda?? you can\\'t drink beer there bc they have no liquor license so if you want a beer, you have to go next door and then they bring you your pizza.. and if you want something besides tap water with no ice, you get a choice of 3 seltzer waters..: with no ice. seriously so weird. i ended up going next door to the coffee shop just to get a coke. the pizza was okay, the service was terrible.. nobody came outside to tell us we had to order at the counter, give us menus etc. for just opening up... we were disappointed. wow the pizza is cold and pepperoni is falling off like an afterthought ...wth sbarro?  now mediocre isn\\'t even bad enough u have to go sub par with it... smh probably one of the worst experiences i\\'ve had. we sat down around 6:20pm and it took over an hour to get our food. one table got up and left because it was soooo slow. the salad that was promised took 15 minutes to arrive and we never even got our breadsticks even though we were told 3 different times they were coming. apparently there was only 1 person working the whole kitchen. i wish they would have said something before we wasted our time waiting. honestly i\\'ve had better italian food down the road. the service was sparse and not very friendly. i ordered linguine and meatballs. the meatballs were actually very good but the pasta was over cooked and there was way too much sauce for the amount of pasta given. i most likely won\\'t be returning. i get better food and service at olive garden. i did not stay, i was extremely disappointed to find out you had to be over 21 to sit on the patio at 6pm. i had my 12 year old with me and it was a beautiful night and the inside atmosphere couldn\\'t compare to being outside. i\\'ve never heard of such a policy and couldn\\'t justify staying. wife and i both got sick over their pizza.  it didn\\'t taste right.  i did like the peppers they use.  but that\\'s the only nice thing i have to say. the pizza was not that remarkable.it came barely warm. one person in our party ordered a chicken wrap and as the rest of us finished our pizza the wrap still had not been served. we eventually cancelled it . the staff was apologetic . my daughter ordered a large pizza and 8 wings online. the delivery came and it turned out to be a small pizza and 16 wings. when i called the store and asked them to review the order #, they read the order we received. i explained that\\'s not what my daughter ordered, to which they replied, she must\\'ve hit the wrong buttons and proceeded to hang up. if i wanted to order another pizza, don\\'t you think that would be a perfect opportunity to rectify the problem???  nope!!!  when my wife called back, casey the manager was extremely rude and offered nothing but a customer service phone number. we will never order from papa john\\'s again... no matter where the location. used to be a favorite spot but it has gone down in quality alot. lack of consistency and poor food quality has driven us away. each time we ordered we would say \"let\\'s give them one more try\" but after many chances and disappointment we\\'ve decided we\\'re all set. one time i ordered an individual slice of pizza and asked to add pineapple and when i received my slice it seriously was awful. the cook took pizza from the night before (we came in right when they opened and i knew the pizza was not fresh) , heated it up, then threw on cold fruit cup of pineapple.... which in turn made it a soggy sorry pizza slice.. i mean seriously? wouldn\\'t one think to add pineapple to the pizza then put it into the oven?? ordered for the first time. won\\'t do that again. it didn\\'t taste fresh. it was hard. had burnt pieces on it. really disappointing... ordered a pizza a few weeks ago & have to say it was horrible. it seemed almost raw. the crust was cooked but the cheese was white not the golden color on a good pizza. it\\'s a shame because it\\'s so close to home. we\\'ve had food from there before but it\\'s been awhile & it use to be good. i guess i\\'ll be sticking with rocco\\'s because they are always consistently good. um caliente seriously!?!\\n\\nso after work i decided to order a pizza a pie. nothing too crazy. a red pizza by my definition is a pizza with red sauce on it. apparently, not this time. anywho i ordered a red pizza with parmesan on the side and garlic sauce.\\n\\ni received: cheese with extra red sauce. no parmesan, and some weird sauce with green stuff in it maybe it cilantro/basil i don\\'t know. plus it was undercooked! thats kind of a trifecta of badness by my definition. i dont know. i would like to say this was the first time i\\'ve received an undercooked pizza which i had to send back but alas it is my third.\\n\\ncaliente, whats going on?!?! i\\'m confused, bewildered, baffled even. step your game up or else giovanni\\'s is more than welcome to take my money anyday. i don\\'t even know what to say, simply awful. i had \"meat\" lasagna which was like a game of where\\'s waldo because i couldn\\'t find any meat. he waiter just seemed put out. i\\'ll stick with nora\\'s for good italian and better service customer service here is terrible. i ordered a pizza on my way home from a 40 min drive, realizing i forgot my purse at work when i went to pick it up. no offer to look up my card number or anything so who knows what happened with the food - hopefully it did not go to waste. after about an hour and a half when i was on my way home again at 9:40, 20 min away, i called again to order, the person on the phone kept hitting buttons and telling me the disruption was on my end and in between the loud beeps, asked me if i could be there by 10 because they close their doors at 10. needless to say, i said forget it and placed my second order at one of the many nearby stores that keep their doors open way past 10 pm on a friday night. and when i drove by on my way home from driving out of my way for the second time that night around 10:30 pm, all the employees were standing around talking in the parking lot. must have had important things to do. won\\'t be ordering from them again. please avoid this place. had bad experiences after the other. the last straw was when i asked a philly cheesesteak only with american cheese & oil and vinegar \\n\\ni received a philly cheesesteak with mushrooms and green peppers. i told the manager i didn\\'t request this , he said its my fault, stuff already comes on the cheesesteak regardless of what i requested (american cheese & oil & vinegar) i was shocked. no apology or anything. walked about with no refund or no sandwich. this restaurant sucks people if you want real italian food in charlotte go to joe mammas, it\\'s on south tryon but further down. i\\'m from ny and these guys would be outta business if they pulled something off like that there! for some reason, they are refusing to accept my debit card to purchase movie tickets because it says \"movie pass\" on it. the manager is convinced that they are being cheated out of money for some reason? they refused to do anything about it and just told me they would not accept it. terrible service. they lost multiple costumers from this experience. me and all me extended family that were planning on going to the movies together. i really enjoyed this place until tonight\\'s experience.  i don\\'t eat meat, so i ordered the mushroom risotto which has been fabulous in the past.  i ate a few bites and i tasted. . . chicken.  i looked and i could see what looked like chicken amid the rice and mushrooms.  i had my husband confirm it was in fact chicken.  i called over our waitress who confirmed that my dish should not contain chicken.  she said she would check with the kitchen and find out why my food contained chicken.  she came out a bit later and said she really did not have an explanation why my meal was made with chicken.  after a bit of a wait, she did bring me a new dish, this one not contaminated with chicken.  i was a bit surprised when she presented us with our check and we were charged full price for everything.  when our waitress came to pick up our check, i let her know it did not think it was appropriate that they made the error that they did and then did nothing about it.  only then did she take my husband\\'s dessert off the bill.  we paid the check and left.  because this situation was so badly handled, my husband and i will never go back to stone and vine. ordered a hawaiian pizza, got half hawaiian,half cheese, and half burnt.\\nthey vaguely describe that their \"sandwiches\" are calzones. they\\'re kind of good. the wings are not like they used to be seems like frozen cheap wings from walmart and the prices went way up thx to new law of 10hr i\\'ve been ordering from here now for 5 years but i want be no more not worth the extra money the pizza was ok but not great like in the past okay the food was not good at all to much money i will never come back there are so many other restaurant to eat italian food better an less money i can cook better an charge less money ..  the ads on line are false the pictures are nothing what you get . they show a round pizza an they give you a square what up with that .. the calamari was bad a not enough foe 15.99 an there large cheese pizza was 22.99 for just cheese.. stay far a way for this place . i will never go back an i will let my friends know as well.. i just moved to the area and i have ordered from this location twice... both times our hand tossed pizza showed up as a thin crust! i have ordered this same pizza at our other location several times and the thickness was perfect! our pizza was so thin that it could not even stay together on the ride over. guess i\\'ll try the local papa johns. terrible! this was unfortunately the we worst pizza i have had in a long time! i am staying at the wonderful andaz resort across the street. i thought i would get a quick pizza and bring it back to the room. i am so disappointed. we are ordering from one of the large chains so we can fix our pizza craving now.  sad...small...thin...pitiful pizza. you will notice that i never leave bad reviews but this time i have to. yuck!!!!! i wasted $18 plus a $2 tip! horrible management, horrible service. i would not recommend this place to anyone! manager was incredibly rude and did not care that we had complaints about service and told us to leave if we didn\\'t like it. he was arrogant and belligerent and i will never try and go there nor recommend this place to anyone i know or don\\'t know. before going to rizzo\\'s last night, after attending ilms graduation, we checked online to see the hours.  the website said they were opened until 10.  tuesday - saturday: 11:00 am - 10:00 pm.  we arrived at approximately 8:40, got a nasty look from one of ther servers, asked if they were open until 10, she immediately said 9:30 (strike 1), we then said to another server \"are we too late for dinner\" - no (strike 2).  as we were taken to our table, the hostess threw down the silverware (strike 3), so we left and went down the street to mama\\'s pizzeria and they were glad to serve us even though it was 8:55.  we called rizzo\\'s and asked to speak to the manager.  we were told he couldn\\'t come to the phone because they were busy.  we just left there, they weren\\'t busy (3 families in the dining room who already had their food.  we were told he would call us back - no call.  we won\\'t be going there again.  if they are only open until 9:30 on a thursday night they may want to change their website times.  we purposely called to make sure we (and they) would have enough time. summary:  the restaurant was empty, but they made me wait until i just gave up and left.  in the meantime, i watched them immediately seat two other walk up parties who came after me.\\n\\ndetails:  it was just after 9 pm on a wednesday night.  i was hungry, so i thought i\\'d try lupo.  i walked up to the hostess stand and asked for a table.  \"one, please\", i asked.  she asked if i preferred a table or if i would like to sit at the bar.  i asked for the table, please.  she told me it would be a couple of minutes while they \"cleared off a table\", but from the hostess stand i could see at least 10 empty tables, with placed settings and ready to go.\\n\\nafter a couple of minutes, a party of three people came up behind me.  i was still standing at the hostess stand, so i politely stepped aside so those people could talk to the hostess.  she asked them how many.  they said three.  she grabbed three menus and said \"right this way\".  i wondered to myself why those people were being seated immediately, but i said nothing and  continued to wait patiently.\\n\\nafter a few more minutes a couple walked up to the hostess stand.  just as with the previous party, the hostess asked how many.  they said two.  she grabbed two menus and said \"right this way\".  i continued to wait patiently.\\n\\nthe hostess came back to the stand.  she didn\\'t say a word to me.  she just fidgeted around with whatever was on the podium.  after a couple of minutes, she walked away from the podium, leaving me standing there, still waiting.  i finally decided lupo wasn\\'t earning my business, so i left.\\n\\nit is las vegas, so i\\'m sure they get their fair share of obnoxious people that they might like to avoid serving.  however, i was stone-sober, dressed in slacks, a button down shirt and tie.  and i was polite the whole time.  \\n\\nperhaps this is a good restaurant if they like you, but if they ignored me they may also ignore you.  if you want to try this restaurant, i\\'d recommend having a back-up plan in case they decide they aren\\'t serious about your business. this will be my last time here. pizza is full of a ton of grease. the guys who make the pizza use their bare hands, then toggle back and forth to the cash register. last night my pizza was just a puddle of grease, its not even edible. their prices are outrageously expensive for the quality. its the closest to my house but i think the pizza at the 7-11 is better quality now. this place has really gone down the tubes. its just not what it used to be. a friend told me the one on s. buffalo is the real roccos to go. something about a bad break up between then two guys. i also spent 18 bux on a veal parm sub. seems a little pricey for the sub. it was good but not 18 dollar worth good. their pizza is just a greasefest. it must just be really low end cheese to create that. my recommendation would be to go to bambinos or east side for quality pizza. if you want really low end stuff that is over priced, come here and get some pizza that just sits out all day. i cannot give a score on the restaurant because we never made it past the host stand.  we arrived with a group wanting to drink and eat at the long table in the bar.  \\n\\nafter having the same convesation with the hostess three times about (1) that we were eating and (2) that yes, i would like her to clean the table for us (it was literally like three rounds of ground hog day) she told us that we could not sit there because two people were already ready there.  two people at a communcal table for 20.\\n\\nthat was when i lost my mind.  and we left.  the worst hostess experience ever. the worst customer service i have ever seen. the clerks had the attention span of a five year old. the call taker was rude and unprofessional. i don\\'t recommend this place to anyone. this place has gone way downhill.  when it first opened it was pretty good. but now, it\\'s terrible.  the service is not good. the food is overpriced and not very good.  i have had better chicken marsala at non-italian places.   they can\\'t get the orders correct and the drinks are watered down and the bar tender is not pleasant.  won\\'t be back. i went there thinking they had fresh ingridients, when the lady brought out the crust it looked a bit dry and stale. she thossed it in the trash and tried another, then explained to me that the ingridients are shipped from indianna...for 15 bucks i got a pizza that i could have made a better one myself with boboli crust and cheese from albettsons.i wont go there again i make better pizza myself would definitely not eat here again. just bought a $20 pasta and i was so disappointed when i opened it. it was so small and there was just nothing to it. i don\\'t like leaving one stars but this one calls for it. about a month back i prefer delivery from them. it took over an hour and half cause the driver was new . i called and spoke with a manager  allegedly and was told they would credit my account with a free pizza . i call in a few weeks later and the person i spoke with said there is nothing noted on my account . i explained the situation and was told he couldn\\'t do anything for me cause it was just hear say and he can\\'t go off my word so pretty much called me a liar lol i was like wow great costumer and i would contact their corporate about this to which he replied \" is there anything else i can help u with if not good bye \" and hung up ....i can see why papa johns sales is down ... amazing worst service ever! we had reservations and were seated right away but we waited 20 minutes for water, a menu, bread, table set-up, and a server. when he finally showed up, he had the nerve to ask \"how\\'s it going?\". not well buddy.... for the above reasons.they weren\\'t terribly busy which made the lousy service even more annoying. we\\'ve been to lupo three times and this will be our last. had dinner at two other restaurants during our stay and they were both wonderful. i\\'d recommend gallagher\\'s at ny-ny if you really want great service. stay away from lupo if you\\'re hungry or thirsty. service was good.  food was terrible, from bread stick and dips to artichoke/goat cheese ravoli to seafood risotto.  my companion ended up with food poisoning, think it was the clams!   would not go there again. i had a terrible waiter tonight at cpk, i waited what seemed like forever for him to appear. i requested bottled water and after 10 minutes he told me they didn\\'t have any. i ordered a glass of wine and an unsweetened ice tea. he didn\\'t bring my ice tea. when he brought my pizza i mentioned my iced tea, he apologized and bought it. he didn\\'t return to ask if i needed anything. i flagged him down and asked for a box which he retrieved and basically threw on the table. i flagged him again for my check left the $ amount and a tip and left. i will definitely contact corporate to express my dissatisfaction with him. the food was good he was horrible. ordered for delivery and was told to expect a 40 minute wait, after an hour and a half our cold pizza\\'s arrived. \\n the meat lovers pizza contained tasteless greasy italian sausage, soggy pepperoni, and cold crusty ham slices in extremely sparing amounts.\\n the grilled steak chipotle pizza came completely without sauce. nothing better than a cold dry pizza.\\n would not recommend to my worst enemies. worst customer service ever ! driver first got our order wrong three times and had to keep returning to switch out our pizza then our mozzarella sticks then we got the wrong 2 liter. driver then offers a meal on her for all the inconvenience and doesn\\'t fall thru with her offering. every time we order from them our order is always wrong. i\\'d rather go to dominos ! poor communication of events that will affect restaurant traffic, terribly limited parking. one of the very worst pizza hut\\'s i have ever dealt with. they messed up my order, promised me a $15 credit in return, and then rob and tatiana refused to honor the credit. their customer service skills were laughable. rather than giving me a free cheese pizza, rob spent 15 minutes on the phone interrogating me. and tatiana seems to have never had a customer service job prior to this in her entire life. i ended up going to domino\\'s pizza, where i got much better service for the same price. i\\'ve forgiven their rudeness over the phone many times, basically because i am able to order online. tonight my son forgot to order one of our pizzas online and they gave him so much grief about adding to the order that i finally took the phone. asked the guy if we could add to the order, or at least have 2 online orders delivered at the same time. i get on the phone and this jack wagon says \"it\\'s not magic, ma\\'am!\" ummm not asking for magic. he hung up on me. solid business skills. cancelled my order and got dominos. learn some people skills, you idiots came here on saturday night there was a line of people waiting to be seated but we had reservations so we\\'re promptly seated. started with the carpaccio and the burrata board, both were very good and great portions. i ordered the pesto chicken pizza with jalapeños and the hubby had veal piccata with the fried gnocchi. the pizza was great but i have to admit my husbands dish was amazing. i\\'m pretty sure it was the fried gnocchi that just took it over the top!!! dessert however was a huge disappointment we had the zeppole which was fried phyllo dough that was extremely greasy and somewhat undercooked. i\\'m definitely going back but staying away from the dessert! \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwow what a difference when you do take out! we ordered the bruschetta which was fine but the burrata board was anything but....it was literally less than half the size of the one we ordered when we sat down for dinner. if i\\'m paying the same price as if we were to sit down why am i only getting a portion of the food?! consistency is the key when it comes to restaurants survival, why would we want to return if we don\\'t even know what we will be getting i ordered nearly $50 worth of food. it was for my son\\'s birthday.  it took over an hour for delivery to arrive and then they did not even deliver it to my door. i had to go down 3 stories and pick it up from the parking lot and still tipped the driver $7.00. every single item was inedible.  some was undercooked. some was burned.  all of it was awful. i immediately called to complain (not my usual) and found oitbtjat it was routed through a call center in alaska. i finally reached the location after being hung up on several times. i was told they could not refund my card, so i informed them i had paid in cash.  i was told i would receive my money back. an hour later i called the call center again and was put on hold at which time i was told they could not exchange the food as there was no more foid at the reataurant????? i was told an hoir later that the driver was bringing my money back to me. food is completely uneaten and waiting to be picked up when the owner calls me and informs me he refuses to refund me and offers me a free pizza. do not order fron this place! it is disgusting and someone will end up sick as a result. i\\'ll never see my money, but maybe i can save you some. this place has gone from bad to worse. now besides the overcooked noodles, you have to contend with flies buzzing around and landing in your food. and, the manager tells me they\\'re fruit flies. i\\'m so glad to know he knows what they are, now why don\\'t they get rid of them. i was told they\\'re coming from outside! [insert eye roll and head shaking here.] none of the other restaurants in market square have fruit flies. yuck! my wife and i stopped here for dinner and were seated outside on the patio (fine so far). the waiter (owner?)took forever to come out but it was busy. he acted bored while we ordered our appetizers and actually was staring directly over my head while i ordered. whatever, we wrote it off as weird. the cheese plate was dismal. there is no way they make that cheese fresh, and i could have gotten better cheese at the trader joes around the corner for a third of what theirs cost. eventually our snobby waiter made it back to our table. he told us the specials and again wouldnt look at either of us...when we ordered a margherita pizza to share he literally huffed and said \"is that all?\" and walked off. we were flabbergasted. he did not return their the entire duration of our stay, not to bring us more drinks, not to get our dessert order, not even to ask how the food was (not great-a margherita pizza should have a certain type of mozzarella and some fresh basil on it. this looked like a generic by the slice type pizza you would find at any chain joint)\\nseriously we are both pretty easy going and not terribly demanding of a server. but to be flat out ignored and treated like they didn\\'t want us there was outrageous. i don\\'t know what that guys problem is, but if the management cares about their business at all they need to address those problems. as it is, we won\\'t ever go back, and i would tell anyone who asked me about what a terrible experience we had and how mad we were upon leaving after waiting 2 hours for the check. i had to get up and ask the guy at the door for the check. he was the only nice person there. i would like to put a 0 for this place. we didn\\'t even eat here. we got seated and ignored for 20 mins while other people that got seated later and got waited on. wait staff was very snooty. we were dressed business casual. there were 3 in our party. lupo wasn\\'t even busy at all. the hostess was cold as well. when we left she said \"have a nice day\". wolfgang puck really let me down. a large pizza with sausage (more like pepperoni), mushroom and green peppers for 30$????  are you kidding me? i haven\\'t made it to my seat yet, and will most likely amend my review...  but the atrocious treatment we have received so far is very disheartening to say the least... stay tuned for more. extremely rude management. i\\'ve never dealt with any establishment so poorly ran. i highly recommend avoiding this place and choosing another restaurant within the area. nasty! i was so excited to check it out after reading all the great reviews.  just went to nyc in oct so wanted to compare.  sorry not ny style pizza. first visit to this location and am extremely disappointed.  sad to know who served me is now getting 10/hr. i know someone could provide a way better customer experience than this person did for the same amount of money.  if i was a business owner i\\'d be firing a crew like this as i\\'d lose out on business.  \\n\\nfirst of all i arrived to find a hand drawn note on the door stating sorry we will open at 11, when they should have opened at 10:30a. \\n\\nsecond they opened after 11 and the guy had no customer service once he unlocked the door.  once i  entered nothing was said to me i simply stood near the register waiting to be acknowledged.  the guy decided to continue working behind the registers while his coworker stood around and snacked on something before i eventually was acknowledged.  \\n\\nthirdly, once i was acknowledged the guy asked what he could get for me.  i said i would like 3 hot and readys please.  he said my total  and then walked away before i could pay .  i continued to wait while he left me at the registers and went in the back area.  \\n\\nfourthly,  i waited over 10 minutes watching him stack up multiple pizza boxes with pizzas,   put stickers on pizza boxes,  placed finished pizzas in the warmers,  watched his co worker  had off a pizza to someone who just drove up to the drive through all while i still stood there waiting.  \\n\\nfifthly, a third co worker eventually arrived and i asked her why that person received their order before me?\\nshe went to the back and words were said between her and the coworkers and she just disappears.  \\n\\nfinally the guy brings me my order stands at the register and just stares at me... i ask him  oh are you ready for me to pay now??  he says yes and the total.  \\n\\nif i didn\\'t have  a hard working team i wanted to appreciate i would have just left.  i chose to go through this experience to the end and now here i am. . i hope the owners read this and take discipline on those employees.  if you don\\'t believe me.  check your cameras. please nobody go here they serve you cold food it takes 2 1/2 hours to get there and then when you call to let them know your food is cold they hang up on your face and before they hang up they tell you what what do you want me to do about it i am furious and i asked the guys name he said hi this is james but then i asked him his name again because the thought of getting rudy he said it\\'s joey ridiculous liars don\\'t go bear and i will be sending better business bureau into that place is disgustingness i would give them no stars if i could. literally the worst and i mean worst spot i have been to. there are never any hot and ready available. they do not acknowledge you. they do not take your order. you will wait 20 minutes for a place that suppose to give you your food right away. awful!!! i ordered two gyros, an italian sub, and naked wings. it took over an hour for it to be delivered (i was told 30 min). when my food came i had hot wings, so i called to say i might have received someone else\\'s wings, the woman was so rude to me! she told me i would have to wait 20 min for them to make my wings, wait for a driver to come back, and then they\\'d deliver them. when i said i don\\'t want to wait that long since i had waited an hour already the woman started yelling at me! the gyros that did come were more lettuce and tomato than meat, and they had ranch dressing on them and no onion? the italian sub was only salami and ham with a bunch of lettuce and tomato. needless to say i will never be ordering from here again. says closed at 2:00pm and no sign was outside saying closed until i literally walked up to the door and then closed magically. you crackers are a** one of the worst pizza hut experiences ever. long story short, not only did they mess my order up, but also the other 3 orders prior to me as well. and all three of them got complimentary meals without asking. but not me, maybe they felt as if i wouldn\\'t notice. very unorganized store. do not go there. this pizzeria place is terrible. the service was rude and they refused to let us eat our food at the table due to \"health code rules\". we were told that we could eat outside! we were able to order drinks but were told rudely several times that we could not have our pizza until we left the premises. very unacceptable imho i ordered 2 hot beef sandwiches with fries and a side salad. said it would be 45-60 minutes for the order. it\\'s a friday so i understand must be busy. i get there 45 minutes later and it\\'s half empty, wonder if there was a rush before, i got my food and left. got home and realized they forgot my salad, called them and told them, they went and checked and said \"oh yeah it\\'s here, if you want it you can come get it.\" i don\\'t live very far fortunately but they didn\\'t even offer to drop it off or anything. i get things happen sometimes, but i didn\\'t even get an apology until i was leaving with my salad, terrible service. we tried to call ahead to order a pizza.  no answer after several attempts and we thought this may be because of monday night football.  my husband goes to pick up knowing he\\'ll have to wait because they never ever have \"hot and ready\" any time of any day.  he places the order and the employee rings up the wrong thing.  my husband corrects him, and 3 or 4 orders are placed after my husband\\'s order.  my husband watches the employee put the other orders in the oven.  he then comes over to my husband and again asks what it is he wanted.  my husband repeats the order.\\n\\nafter waiting and not paying close attention (mistake on his part, but then again...) the employee asks again what we wanted as he hands the box to my husband.  he of course comes home with the wrong product.  we had ordered the 5 meat pizza that is $9 in the tv commercials and received stuffed crust pepperoni.\\n\\nwe tried to call back and of course no answer.  this did not surprise us as we encountered this before going to the shop, and they did not even attempt to answer the phone while my husband was in the shop.  i shot off a message to the company while my husband made a return trip to try to rectify the situation.  i was told to take my comment to customer support.  i tried and the site froze on the 3rd page.  so, the whole company more or less \"backed up\" the bad service received at the shop.\\n\\nupon return, the employee got sarcastic with my husband insisting the product received was correct even after seeing the evidence that it was not.  we were able to keep the mistake but only received a $5 pizza as more or less an apology when we had ordered a higher-priced product.  \\n\\nin the end we received 2 incorrect products.  the first had to be reheated.  it was mediocre at best when eaten but now has me ill with heartburn and stomach cramps.  i guess it\\'s safe to say both the pizza and the customer service have left very bad tastes in my mouth. worst service. overcharged - and lied to over and over again while the delivery guy tried to think of a reason to stick. there is no reason a medium pizza that\\'s 14.99 on your website should come to $25 before tip - especially when that\\'s not what i was quoted on the phone. \\n\\nmy own fault for ordering from dominos in a moment of apartment packing craziness. terrible!  the wings are hard and taste like them cooked them yesterday.  the pizza was soggy and we found a piece of long hair in pizza!!! will never go again. i would give it zero stars if we could. if i could do a negative rating i would. i have never been here prior to tonight\\'s fiasco and not sure i could be convinced to return. i was like oh how fun - movies, games and a bar? fun adult night. we reserved our tickets and arrive early to check out the amenities. well...we head to the bar after getting our tickets and i sit there for 10-15 minutes...as young girls walk up and are served immediately. now, i\\'m not a 22 year old but i\\'m not exactly shrek either. i finally sat at the bar holding my debit card on my forehead. still was looked over. after other people at the bar directed the bartender - and i use that term very loosely - over to me, i indicated i wanted the drink shown on the standup sign on the bar. he looks at me...says \"what\\'s that....?\" reading the sign. i\\'m like uhhhhhhh no thank you. i head to the concession area and ask if there is a manager. the young lady informs me that was the manager ( while rolling her eyes). she then asks if i would like another manager. why yes....i believe i would. the other \"manager\" comes over and i repeat my story. only to be told \" well i feel for him ...he isn\\'t really the bartender \". ok. this is a saturday night. shouldn\\'t there be a \"real bartender\" on what i would assume is their big night of the week? i ask \" so....this is my first time ...and probably my last time...here. and i will be sure to tell everyone about my experience. do you even care?\"  the response was a blank look reminiscent of helen keller at a rock concert - nada. never again. good thing i had a fandango gift card for the tickets. just sayin. i had a mad craving all day for kfc. i stopped on my way home from work and got a 3 piece meal. i got a soda as part of the meal. my chicken was awful. it tasted like it was cooked in old oil. i ate some of it almost an hour ago and my mouth still feels like it has a film in it from the oil.  my soda was flat.  my biscuit was flat ( it was not because of the ice because i had ordered it with no ice).  i called the store and they said they would replace the chicken but that in addition to bringing my receipt, which is understandable, i had to bring back the chicken!  i called the 800 number for kfc and they are compensating me for the whole meal.  i love kfc but will never go to this location again! went there today because i heard they had good lunch specials. i order a chicken sandwich, because i only had about 45 minutes to eat and return to work. sat down at about noon, ordered, got ignored the whole time, and didnt get my food till 12:50. which i politely mentioned when i arrived i was in a rush, and my sandwich wasnt a sandwich, it was a wrap. the cook came out and asked if i wanted some chipotle ranch sauce, i said well sure because i didnt get my mayo.... i stood and stared at him for five minutes while the \"cute\" (old lady in a 20 year old\\'s dress) bartender walked around with my debit card talking to more customers as i stood at the bar with my bag and food in hand, tapping my foot. never going back. it is hard to isolate the single worst thing about hob nobs.  is it the shabby management?  the filthy cook?  or the hipster emo counter staff?\\n\\namber, who took our order clearly thinks customer service is beneath her.  we ordered cesar salads and a sandwich.  the salads were served fairly quickly by a cook who\\'s uniform was clearly encrusted with a week\\'s worth of food debris.  gross... but where the hell is my sandwich?  after 17 minutes of waiting for the sandwich, i asked the soccer mom behind the counter, to which she replied, \"hon, they take a few minutes.\"\\n\\nafter another five minutes, i got pissed.  it is a sandwich.  nobody asked them to make a rack of lamb.  bread, meat, cheese, garnish, and a few condiments.  pretty basic stuff, right?  \\n\\nwhen i finally complained to the bald guy in the bad hawaiian shirt who apparently runs the place, he simply said, \"sorry\" and made the sandwich in front of me.  amber, the emo counter girl, started to complain to me that they were busy and someone had  called off.  bad hawaiian shirt guy sent her out to smoke.  i watched through the window as she commiserated with filthy cook guy, and then returned to work without bothering to wash her hands.  gross again.\\n\\ni would eat daily at the phoenix rescue mission before setting foot in hob nobs again.  at least there the staff is nice, and want to help. i don\\'t write reviews but --- \\n\\nhands down one of the worst customer service experiences i\\'ve ever had at what\\'s supposed to be a nice area in chandler.  i\\'m staying at the crown plaza resort and placed my order which was suppose to be delivered in 15 minutes. i waited an hour and called back.  was told it was sitting there and he would \"bring it right up\". i asked him if it would be cold sitting there for 45 minutes and was told he\\'d \"warm it up\".  i waited another 25 minutes and called back to talk to manager. jason apparently was the manager on and was very rude and short and pretty much hung up after i told him i wanted to cancel my order due to poor service. he never even apologized or asked to make it up.  horrible service.   would not recommend. first visit and will not go back.  walking to the bath room you would be lucky to make it without falling, the floors were greasy and disgusting, and when i told the hostess about it, she said if i had the power to change it i would......what??  i said you do have the power  go tell your manager...she said that there was not manager there and the owner wasn\\'t there either.  i asked again to see a manager and she made a face at me, and went the back ...someone who claimed to be the front of the house manager came and gave me nothing but excuses and told me she would be happy to talk to me about it with an attitude that was just as disgusting as the floors.  \\n\\nfood was disappointing as well.  if they continue with this pattern, they will be closed soon. \\n\\nbad!! sbarro is mediocre at best on any given occasion however it turns out its especially bad at airport locations. took an hour for food to be prepared.  noodles were not cooked and tasted sticky.  when we asked for the pasta to be cooked they must have thrown water on the dish and stir fried it because the dish came back soggy and bland.  ruined the evening. my recent visit for lunch left me chuckling! i arrived and took a seat at the bar since i was dining solo.  another couple was at the bar.  a very sweet bartender took my order.  she couldn\\'t answer any questions, though, because it was her first day serving lunch.  nice job training staff. i ordered wine, a simple salad with lemon vinaigrette, and the chicken meatballs.  quite a bit of time went by when i overheard the manager apologizing to the couple at the bar because the kitchen fired chicken meatballs for them instead of regular meatballs.  she gave them the dish gratis. yep, they were my meatballs. the bartender figured it out and admitted to me--no apology or even a word from the manager.  then my food came out-both the salad and meatballs together.  could it hurt to train the server to ask if you want both served together? i ate the meatballs first, which is a good thing because they were barely warm.  they were kind of tasty, but had a costco prefab texture. the salad was inedible due to copious amounts of salt thrown on it.  bartender finally asked me how everything was, and i told her that the salad was inedible and the chicken meatballs (while i ate them all because i was starving) were barely even warm.  manager came over immediately, apologized and said they would fix the salad and comp the meatballs.  i told her that i would pay since i ate them, but she insisted. she went on to say that they were probably not that warm because they rushed to get them out and probably didn\\'t cook them long enough. eeeek!! did i just eat undercooked chicken? well, i didn\\'t get sick so i\\'m guessing my thought that they were \"pre-fab costco\" type meatballs is probably correct.  they are possibly pre-made, pre-cooked and just warmed up when ordered.  for $12 for 5 tiny meatballs--unacceptable. the restaurant is attractive inside, but there were a number of workers sitting at community tables doing paperwork--they were obviously not customers. this is a pet peeve of mine.   for the hype, the price, and the parking hassle, i don\\'t think i would bother giving searsucker another try.  oh by the way, the second salad came out perfect.  simple fresh greens, a little radish, and lemon vinaigrette. hard to understand how they screwed it up the first time. delivery was nice. fries had a bucket of salt on them. me and my brother gagged!!!hummus wasn\\'t fresh. your sausage  pizza was rotten. tasted like mold...terrible terrible food!!!! so i couldn\\'t tell you what gus\\' pizza tastes like because they wanted a $7 service charge (before tip) on an $11 order to deliver anything.  classic craphole that will be out of business soon. this place is a wet, dirty diaper.\\nthe dirty food matches its dirty neighborhood. \\ntheir slow drivers on oxy can\\'t figure directions from a mile away. when delivered, their pizza was lukewarm and tasted what i assume was old lady\\'s socks. this food will give raccoons nightmares.\\nperfect food to give to an enemy or gf you are breaking up with. this place wins the award for the worst fish n chips i\\'ve ever had. this was years ago, so maybe they have their act together now... but the piece of fish they gave me was the tiniest piece i had ever seen in my life. (maybe the size of a few thick cut french fries) i essentially paid 10 dollars for a plate of fries. i think they might have run out of fish in the back? either way, the food is not the greatest... and there is a ton of other options in the neighbourhood i\\'d rather go to. big smoke, coco rice, the one that got away...\\n\\nif i was the kind of person to send something back i would have. but i am the kind of person that just never returns. i ordered a slice of chocolate cake and got something more like a chocolate mousse no cake involved ps i don\\'t like chocolate mousse! worst delivery service in the las vegas pizza market.  the first time i ordered pizza it took 1 hour and 30 minutes to get my pizza.  this time i ordered, told them on the phone i would pay cash and they show up and tell me they don\\'t have change for my 2 twenty dollar bills.  really?  what a mess this place is.  i have no idea how they stay in business.  time for me to give some of the other places a try. love the food but huge problem when i pulled up the website and menu for the specific location and read my order he had no idea what i was asking for and asked what i was looking at. i stated the menu form yelp took me to your website i even picked the specific location too, then  he said we don\\'t have any of the kinds so the 5 items i intended on ordering we\\'re not available at all. very disappoint not to include i sound like a person that didn\\'t have a clue what i was ordering. he kept saying your looking at the wrong menu and i clearly was not.  very frustrated. so moral of the complaint don\\'t prepare your order b4 ordering cause its completely wrong. really ?!??!?!? the service here is terrible. it took over 5 minutes for anyone to get to me standing at an empty bar, i in fact had to go find a member of the staff. once ordering 2 cold apps to go out took over 10 minutes to recieve 2 extremely small portions of which i payed $9.00 for... i expressed my need to leave and the bartender told me that she can\\'t just snap her fingers and have food appear. i will never go back pass this place- the food and service here were awful. \\n\\nwe came into this place with a reservation when we arrived in vegas in september and right off the bat were not greeted at all. we should have known from there the experience would be bad. \\n\\nwe sat down and were immediately rushed into ordering our food and drinks- after our drinks came, which were blah, our food  finally came. we ordered a traditional pepperoni pizza and a side of their so-called-famous meatballs. \\nthe pizza was so greasy that the oil was literally dripping off the side of the pizza while it was sitting on the stand. when we picked up a slice it would fall apart bc it was so greasy.\\n\\nthe meatball was just ok. nothing to write home about. \\n\\nwhen our server came back to check on us we mentioned to her that the pizza was on the greasy side. she then said in a very rude tone that \"that is how it is and that is normal for all pizza\". i was offended with that remark. she has no idea what kind of pizza is normal if she thinks that was normal. \\n\\nany who, the manger came over and had a very similar attitude. \\n\\nwe paid our expensive tab and left- never to return, as i urge you to do the same. the positives: staff was friendly and the beer was cold. that\\'s it. \\n\\ntwo kids spaghetti and meatballs was disappointing. noodles were cooked fine, the meatballs were small and bland, and the sauce was runny and wasn\\'t nearly enough to coat half the noodles let alone the entire plate. and for $6 each that\\'s ridiculous. \\n\\n\\nwe order the mama\\'s supreme pizza. the order took well over 30 min for the pizza. half the crust was burnt. the toppings were limited and the flavor was blah.  \\n\\nvery disappointed and won\\'t be returning. i give it one star because the driver was nice but that was the only good part of my experience. online order was different than email confirmation which was different from the food that actually arrived and according to these people that was my fault. i had to drive to the shop with wrong food and get my money back. was told never to order from them again. don\\'t worry i won\\'t. the linguini with scallops was like ramen noodles and 4 tiny scallops.\\nthe meal was horrible and the bottles of wine were marked up 500%. i asked for extra bread and received ins half piece.\\nthe meal sucked i will never return! wow ~ i don\\'t know what\\'s happened to this place, but it has seriously gone downhill. we were debating ordering some garlic bread, and then remembered our meal came with the complimentary bread, so decided to just go with that. after waiting for about 10 minutes, our waitress came back to tell us \"we\\'re still about 15 minutes out on the bread, so you might want to order some garlic bread if you want bread before your meal\". i asked her if we were supposed to pay for bread simply because they didn\\'t have any ready, and she said \"i guess if you want some, that\\'s your only option\". ummmm how about comping the $3.50 garlic bread since it was your error to begin with? maybe it\\'s a small thing but it was so tacky and they just have a \"couldn\\'t care less\" attitude here...way too many options right in this area to put up with that!! i decided to give this place a chance after i last visited here 3 years ago. maybe things had changed, maybe they worked on the food and maybe it was worth the $$ that they charged their clientele.\\n\\nthe ambiance was just as beautiful and as classy when i walked in. but then i started looking at the details. i was there for a birthday and the tables that were set up were a complete mess. some settings had main menus and sushi menus (i\\'ll get on that in a minute), and some just had menus. i also acknowledge that this is a small thing, but it is the details for a place priced so high but even the sugar packet holder wasn\\'t presentable. it looks like random packets were just jammed in while in a rush. \\n\\nthere were some good things though. i was told that the penne arbiatta sauce was good and i was really impressed that they had a change table for us to change our daughter.\\nnow the bad stuff.\\n\\nwhen was the last time that you went to an italian bistro for the sushi? never right? which it\\'s why i\\'m as confused as to why there is sushi available on the menu here? it has no place and just indicates to me that the restaurant doesn\\'t want to define its identity and bank on what it\\'s good at (not that it is but what it assumes it\\'s good at). i\\'m all for fusion restaurants, but not at a place called bistro grande.\\n\\ni was curious about the seafood risotto for a kosher place, are they going to use pollock? are they going to use imitation seafood? no, when i asked about it, their seafood risotto included tuna and salmon. for $28, i just found that ridiculously overpriced. mid to top range seafood risottos would be priced around $22 and it would at least be true to what people would expect the dish to be. if i ordered this dish and received just tuna and salmon, i would be livid. i mean technically it\\'s correct it is seafood, but it\\'s not what most would expect from the order, meanwhile at a higher price.\\n\\ni ended up ordering the fettuccini alfredo instead. i thought \"there would no way they could screw that up and they got 2 of the 3 ingredients in the sauce. parmesan cheese didn\\'t seem to make it in though. so i just had fettuccini in butter and cream. i had to pile it on the pasta after the fact to make it edible. i really wasn\\'t impressed i wouldn\\'t have priced this pasta higher than $9 and that would be even a stretch for me. the pasta was also well overcooked. it was the furthest thing of al dente that it fell apart on my plate. it\\'s actually astonishing the lack of care that these dishes receive and are pushed out to customers.\\n\\ni was also kind of confounded when we asked if we could get a smaller portion for our daughter to eat and we were told \"no\" we\\'d have to order a full portion meal which i wasn\\'t prepared to do if it weren\\'t for the fact that my daughter has the powerful need to eat on occasion.\\n\\nthe restaurant is also in a dead zone (at least for rogers), so don\\'t expect to tweet, instagram, e-mail while you are here.\\n\\nno, i wouldn\\'t recommend going here. i was really unhappy with the food and the service (again). this place is so strange. so we were going out for a last minute birthday dinner. we went to rigatony\\'s first but it was so packed. an hour wait at least. we decided to go somewhere else instead. marcello\\'s is right across the street. we went there and it was dead. no other cars in the parking lot. that should have been a warning. we went in and i swear the guy at the door looked at us like he didn\\'t know what we were doing there. i had to explain to him that we needed a table so we could eat. so beyond odd. he looked irritated but sat us down. food was bland. alfredo sauce tasted very watered down and their bread is like bread cake or something. very different. way too expensive for bland food. it\\'s a cute place but there\\'s a reason it\\'s so quiet. oh, and some older lady (assuming the owner) kept walking by and just staring at us. i\\'m thinking she was also wondering what we were doing there since by this point we didn\\'t know what we were doing there. make sure to read all reviews. i\\'m a bit confused why all of the 1 stars are not recommended reviews. kind of strange. truly the first restaurant to be fully deserving of a negative star rating, but even yelp is not that unkind.\\n\\nthis is sadly just a review of the consistent failures presented to us within 5mins of entering the establishment, as i opted to save myself further stress and indignation and leave without having a meal here.\\n\\ni arrived at 1:27p.m. for brunch with two friends, unfortunately 12 mins past our reservation time of 1:15p.m.. however they were willing to seat us due to this horrendous tardiness on our part *note sarcasm* (we were stuck in the freezing cold, warring with the pay and park machine which only took coins or credit card and would eject the credit card until we were forced to allocate change). the hostess was kind enough to ask if the seating in the bar, with high chairs and tables would be \"ok\", she never truly expected me to say \"no it\\'s not ok, i am in a short dress and 4 inch heels\" you could at this point see the world about her crumble, as she had no idea how to actually deal with me refusing the seating arrangement. i asked her why they would take a reservation and then within less that 15mins of the booking give away my table? \\nwithout another word she ran off to speak with the other hostess seated at the laptop, who called out from where she was sitting that our reservation was for 1:15p.m. as the 2nd hostess returned, i asked her once more if there were any other options, she stated no and progressed to lead us to the bar area, i at this point refused to continue with this and told her thank you but no, i was then met with a rather nasty snarky remark of \" well good luck with that\" beautiful and professional service from an establishment in yorkville no less.\\nmy guests and i at this point left, as if they could not even hold a reservation for 15mins there was no point in enduring this location further. \\nwe returned to the car and i called to speak to the manager, i was met with a voice mail, left on hold a second time for 5 mins and so on. my boyfriend at this point called to find out what the issue was, and the hostess then stated my name and said \"oh this is the \\'name\\' party\" he said yes and was put through to a male who informed us that our reservation was at 12:15... really? a restaurant unable to actually make a reservation and the manager on site and the hostess having different times? i suspected this level of unethical conduct was perhaps commonplace at this restaurant at this point.. to lie to your patrons.\\nnot only were they unable to actually seat us, when there was a table at the bottom of the stairs that we could see was empty and could seat up to 12 guests, but taking the correct time for a reservation was beyond their ability. he continued his condescending apology and stated \"well if you had waited 5 mins, other seats were available and opening up. half our restaurant was closed\" not only did his hostess refuse any other options when asked, but had frankly dismissed us in a haughty manner with added bonus of a nasty comment. all i received from this gentleman was an arrogant apology without a solution, at this point we left the area and proceeded to have lunch elsewhere. \\nthis experience from a yorkville establishment, that tries to project an upscale image? i was disappointed yet relieved to never be compelled to return. \\nperhaps, if they trained their staff on how to take correct reservations and how to communicate with patrons they would have scored higher and be at the level of a basic mcdonald\\'s. \\nafter reading the other reviews posted on yelp, i am glad we didn\\'t stay. unethical, consistently incompetent behaviour should never be rewarded and this seems to be the standard of this cibo location.\\ni caution you before choosing this location, staff are lacking and as one reviewer said \"it\\'s lipstick on a pig\" with their renovations. your restaurant might look good, but your service and food is what makes you exceptional... yet your establishment has failed at the very basics of service, i shudder to think what your food is like.\\n\\nfor a good brunch experience with servers who know what they are doing, and for exquisite food i suggest sunday brunch at the omni, well worth it...\\nhttp://www.omnihotels.com/hotels/toronto-king-edward/dining/sunday-brunch\\nupdated 16/10/2016 - i suggest their yonge and eglington location. service is superior to their yorkville train wreck. cenci\\'s is a mediocre dive bar at best. i am writing this review as i\\'m sitting at the bar being completely ignored by the young, inattentive bartender who is obviously only concerned with taking care of her friends and getting out of work early. it took 15 minutes to take my drink order and now it\\'s been 45 minutes since she\\'s been back, never offering to give me a menu. the good thing is the glasses are are all put away, the dirty glasses are in their bins, the rubber mats for the bar are now all pulled out and her texts have been promptly returned. the only problem is about 10 of us are sitting without drinks while this is all happening. tonight is not an aberration as it\\'s happened several times before. the only plus is they stay open late and the kitchen is open late. other than that, i don\\'t have much good to say about cenci\\'s horrible. i placed a delivery order at 11:00pm and the order was never delivered. i called around 12:00am to see what was happening, and the call was never answered. someone kept picking up the phone and hanging it up. \\ni called the next day to talk to the manager about the situation and he did not seem to care. he didn\\'t offer anything for the inconvenience or apologize about the delivery never arriving. completely disgusted by the lack of customer service. rarely do i receive what i consider \\'fresh\\' food but that is not my complaint.  i was charged one fee (i have receipt) at drive through window.  checking my bank entries the next day, this kfc charged my account twice, neither charge equaling the sales \\'cash sale\\' ticket i received.  when i called to talk to the \\'manager\\' sic he proceeded to tell me there was a 39 cent charge because i used my debit card . .  mind you, none of the totals of the charges calculate to the sales total pus 39 cents.  furthermore, i was never given the option to use the \\'charge\\' portion of my visa/debit.  the \\'manager\\' was rude, insulting, ignorant and much more, none of which is complimentary.  i am attempting to locate corporate to report this - - - while less than a dollar involved, if this \\'scam\\' is used on many folks driving through it is quite a nice little unearned, illegal profit.   they\\'ve seen the last of me - obviously! the food is great and so was our waiter.however your business is not code compliant.you have 2 handicapped spots and one of which always has someone picking up an order.the parking lot is not accessible for wheel chairs and you need to smooth it out so we do not fall. what a disgusting experience. first of all, disclaimer, my boyfriend and i always tip our waitresses for their service. and i can proudly say we tip very well. our total came out to be $52.50 and i have gave the waitress $62.50 making this $10 back in cash. we waited 5 minutes while he continuously passed by our table taking care of the other customers, mind you this place was not busy at all. finally my boyfriend spoke up to another person asking for our receipt,  and our change. a few minutes go by and our waiter comes back to our table with a crumpled up receipt. his response was \" i always throw away the receipts, here you go\" and i quickly respond, \"what about my change?\" he hesitated and mumbled upon words and began to explain of how he was confused that i have give him $62.50. and i responded once again \"to get  $10 back\" he then reaches into his own pocket and pulls out his tip money and gives me my $10. i took that money got up and gave it to the busser who actually helped us. i\\'m sorry but last time i heard it\\'s an option to tip and not a requirement. he didn\\'t give me the option, he just jumped right into it. \\nthis man is an older man with white combed back hair. i am disgusted. after finding the place walking around the building looking for the door, the food was not good at all & over priced.\\nwould not go back absolutely terrible service. our server was the most clueless guy. he told us that he didn\\'t recommend the lasagna and the extra thin crust pizza. so i ordered anyways.  pizza was ok.  the lasagna tasted like the forest floor. this place is terrible. we will never go to this sauce again. i ordered a salad and a pizza. we finished the salad and waited and waited for the pizza. i got up and asked the waitress if they forgot the pizza, she laughed and said yes that they forgot and it would be 10 min before we could get it.  she never apologized or offered to take some of the price off, nothing. just rude!! absolutely horrible!! messed up the order called back to get it fixed and they were rude about it... burnt the pizza and refused to replace it cuz a piece of it was missing... ordered a geek salad and was given italian and caesar dressing!! will not be ordering from them again!! terrible we ordered on a wednesday at around 5:30 pm. the order arrived by 6 and was fresh and hot. it was, however, missing the potato wedges which we called the store about. they were redelivered about 45 minutes later. after calling about the wedges (which my daughter really wanted, so she didn\\'t eat), we realized one of the pizzas was missing half the toppings. decided not to call. the online ordering was good but does not allow for 1/2 and 1/2 pizzas. not really family friendly.\\n\\nsorry pizza 73, not gonna order again. saw the episode of diners drive ins & dives, and was very disappointed with the food both times we have gone there.  first time we went for breakfast but it was close enough to lunch that i ordered a burger.   the burger was way under cooked and the garlic fries had about 1/4\" of oil sitting in the bottom of the tray.  we decided to go again last night for dinner knowing that the food had to be better, but we left pretty unsatisfied with the quality of the food, and the care in preparation/presentation of the food.  i ordered the hot dog with the pulled pork on it and my wife ordered the garden burger.  the garden burger, according to my wife, lacked any true flavor on it\\'s own.  very thin and the whole sandwich just looked like some beginner cook put it together.  my hot dog was warm at best, the bbq pork was just thrown on there with some type of scooper and had cole slaw just dumped on top of that.  the bbq pork tasted like it was from the day before and the temp also matched that.  we paid $27.00 for both our meals and 2 sodas, for that price, i expect that they take more pride in the making of the food and at least make sure it is served hot.  food network should do a follow up show, but show up unannounced and see what they thing then.  sorry, not going back to this establishment any time soon. left me upset enough to create a yelp account. customer service is just important to me as food. i can\\'t really comment on the food but i wanted to share my experience using their delivery service. i found this place here on yelp. looking forward to finding a new place for pizza. i place my order online. i was called within minutes to confirm the order, they told me it was going to be an hour. i said no problem and waited.. after an hour nobody showed up.. i called to get a status. they simply said sorry its already out for delivery. thinking it may show up any minute i waited.... another 30 mins later still nothing. im only a mile away. called again same ol story they gave me an insincere apology, which is why i didn\\'t want to wait any longer. im starving and can\\'t leave because they are still on the way... maybe?? with making no effort to earn a new customer just seem they rather get me off the phone to take more orders. having to repeatedly call with no kinda real info or eta when ill ever get my food. i canceled my order and went to find somewhere else to eat. which defeated the reason why i wanted delivery. if i had knew it would be this frustrating or this long i wouldn\\'t have ordered. they are quick to charge my card but getting food another story. im sure they have wonderful food but ill never know. they have left a bad taste in my mouth. so if you give them a chance don\\'t make it for delivery. i stopped by today an hour before stated closing time and uninterested waiter told me that they are \"done seating\". tables were filthy, trash from prior diners were all over the floor and the one party who was seated seemed to have something on their plate resembling a frozen dinner. recommend avoiding simply due to service mentality. or lack thereof. i ordered one small pizza and one medium pizza directly off their menu with no special additions.  that is not what was delivered to my door.  this was late on a monday night too. not like some busy weekend rush or dinner hour to get in the way.  \\n\\nthe real frustration came in trying to fix the order. after calling the place three times, i was put on hold, hung up on, unable to talk to the same person twice, major communication issues, and not once offered an apology or way to fix this.  they really need to work on the customer service. over two hours later i was left with two small pizzas totaling $ 35.\\n\\nwhile i can\\'t vouch for the actual taste of the pizza since i ended up with plain cheese, the service sucks.  this place just lost my business. not worth the hassle.  i wish the best of luck to the rest of you! i used to like their pizzas, but twice already i couldn\\'t get in! first time, i get a rude employee saying that we aren\\'t open! and tonight i rang the doorbell twice and i was ignored!\\n\\nand another thing...why did you stop serving bacon on pizzas? we ordered after edc last night, we got home and were starving and found their menu slipped under the door of our hotel room, it took over an hour to arrive, then when it got here it was 1 pizza short and we had 1 extra two-liter bottle of pepsi.\\n\\nwhen we had ordered, the woman on the phone when we ordered, repeated our order back to us and it did include only 1 pepsi and 3 pizzas instead of the two we got.\\n\\ni told the delivery guy we didn\\'t order two bottles and he just gave me attitude and said: \"it\\'s what the receipt says, it\\'s just $3 more\".\\n\\ni didn\\'t care that it was just $3 more, my point was we did not want two pepsi\\'s.\\n\\nthen when we called to complain the woman on the other end of the line also had a shitty attitude saying it wasn\\'t their fault that they took the order wrong and that they\\'re just human, mistakes happen.\\n\\nthey told us we could get the pizza we were missing but we would have to return the extra pepsi and pay the remainder of the cost of the pizza plus it would take another hour to arrive.\\n\\nworst service and attitude ever. just got back! this is the third time in a row that pizza was burnt. not only mine but several others as well. also the garlic knots burnt. such a shame. i do not think i will be going back to this place now. how one cannot tell when something is burnt is beyond me. again this was the third time in a row.  heck, even the other person sitting at another table said their fries were burnt as well... open your eyes before you have no more locals coming!!! first and last time i\\'ll be ordering at this location. rude employees. hoping the food would make up for the terrible customer service but they messed up my order too. what a freak show.  waited for a pizza order and watched the counter guy getting his neck and cheeks rubbed by another guy who was wearing a grey coat and was obviously not working there at the time.  another employee start laughing and a fight broke out behind the counter.  they carried the guy in the grey coat out the door and he was swearing up a storm.  the guy he punched eventually waited on me.  i don\\'t know who owns this place but they need to know what happened and what a bunch of misfits are working there.  great food.  creepy employees.  keep the recipe, get new help.  others witnessed this crap.  happened on thursday around 7:30 pm.  never again. i\\'ve eaten enough frozen dinners to know that their alfredo dinner is just a frozen dinner meal reheated. same noodles, sauce, and chicken. same with their jalapeño poppers. stick to the pizza here, it\\'s decent. if this place was in the south, it would be out of business in six months.\\n\\nlet me start by saying i\\'m married to a southern boy and i lived in the south for 10 years. with that, when i found okra\\'s website via a search on yelp, i thought it was the perfect place to take my visiting mother-in-law (also southern) for dinner. reservations were for a friday night.\\n\\nfirst, okra\\'s website really does it justice, more than it deserves. the site makes the restaurant seem warm, urban with a down home spin. the ambiance of okra is the same as so many other restaurants in phoenix--trying too hard to be hip with questionable architecture and poor lighting. not to mention, most of the \"standard\" tables are right in front of the door, which on a cold and rainy night, sends a draft through the space every time the door is opened.\\n\\nthe service was adequate, but not what you would hope for. our server was okay, but aloof and extremely inattentive. she never checked on whether we liked our food or if we needed anything else during the meal. we were nothing more than a table and tip. at least try and fake it!\\n\\nas for the food ... the worst part of the entire okra experience. i ordered the 2-piece regular fried chicken with hush puppies (you have to pay extra for every side, otherwise, all you get is the chicken), my husband got the chicken sandwich with fries and my mother-in-law got a cabbage salad with a side of corn bread and grits. the fried chicken had absolutely no taste. and what i believe was supposed to be a breast had almost no meat on it at all. i mean, when the leg has more meat than the breast, there\\'s something wrong. frankly, they should be ashamed to even serve a piece of chicken like that. the hush puppies were okay, but there was absolutely no presentation to the plate--just two pieces of over-fried chicken on one side and three plain hush puppies on the other. the chicken sandwich was okay, but extremely messy. as for the grits and cornbread--come on okra, really? the grits were waaaaaaay too thick and why is it that you burn the edges of your cornbread? i can assure you that is not how it\\'s done in the south.\\n\\nthe best part of my meal was the okra cup drink. \\n\\njust because you name yourself after the most famous vegetable served in the south and put some wood up in your restaurant does not mean you can legitimately call yourself a fine purveyor of southern cuisine. okra, you have a long way to go. i suggest a long trip through the south to learn from those more concerned about quality and taste than trying to be yet another hipster wannabe eatery in phoenix.\\n\\nperhaps my perspective is a bit skewed, but if you are looking for good southern cuisine, okra is not place. arrived promptly at 7:30 for a reservation for two.  we were told nothing was available and the noncaring receptionist wouldn\\'t even give us an estimate of when we might get the table we reserved.  we went to the bar and before ordering spotted the manager/owner.  when we told him of this situation he offered us two seats at a \"community table\" of twelve.  certainly not what we were interested in.  you would think that he might have had the smarts to offer us a glass of wine.  quite frankly he didn\\'t seam to care.  so, we left and went to hyde park for a great memorable meal. order came cold and incorrect. ordered off grubhub. no fault with grubhub. won\\'t order pizza from this restaurant again. i would like to give it no stars.  the pizza was burnt.  we ordered a cheese plate, and the only thing they got right was the olives (which is standard).  i had to ask for the flatbread that came with it.  we ordered one cheese and two meats... i got two cheeses and one meat and it wasn\\'t even the meat that we ordered.  my cloth napkin had holes in it.  but the bartender is flirting with my boyfriend to make it right... this place sucks. typically a great place to eat, however, tonight i was welcomed with the most rude and unprofessional service.  there is a sign on the door that instructs patrons to ring the bell to gain access for safety.  i rang that buzzer 4 times and allowed the system to time out each time. i called the restaurant and after being on hold for another 2 minutes mentioned to the lady that answered the phone my plight and she was quick and rude. i drove from the east side to get this food after i raved about it to my friends. she was very uncaring. told me i should\\'ve turned the knob and came in then she hung up on me after i told her i wasn\\'t coming back in. i stood inn the cold for 5 minutes giving them the benefit of the doubt. i know she heard the door bell. no way i am ever coming back.  we had plans to use them for the superbowl. i ordered a vegan veggie burger and it came out with a bun that previously had cheese on it and someone unsuccessfully attempted to rip the cheese off the bun and then they just put it back on my veggie burger.   this place sucks!  totally not worth the wait or money.  this place is run by brain washed zombies. i live right by here and have heard all the hype on this place so me, my neighbor and my daughter just ate breakfast here. one word-overrated. \\n\\nbeautiful grounds and scenery but i am rating just by the food, price, and atmosphere. \\n\\nset up is a little confusing. you order from a window and seat yourself. i had no idea. food is pricey and no fresh orange juice they sold tropicana. ordered for 2 adults and a child and it was $32.00. for breakfast. \\n\\nwe ordered omelets, bacon, my daughter had kids french toast. \\n\\nfood so -so and it is not cheap. my daughter did not like the apple crisp bacon. i thought it was ok. me and my friend both got omelets which were just ok. came with a pita bread and salad and a side of fruit. \\n\\nutensils outside and flies everywhere including the inside. we cannot figure out the hype here. we would have had a better breakfast at the good egg. je ne sais pas qui est-ce qui a prit les photos du magnifique plat de viande avec une jolie bouteille mais on ne représente aucunement la réalité. j\\'ai commandé un spaghetti alfredo environs 9$ :\\n\\n-pâtes déjà cuite en commandant. donnant le résultat de pâtes séchés qui ont imbibé toute l\\'eau de la sauce donnant un plat difficile à manger (les pâtes se tenaient d\\'elles même en boule)\\n-sauce sorti tout droit du réfrigérateur (qui ne goûte pas extraordinaire).\\n-français? non. on préfère me laisser parler avec les cuisiniers d\\'un anglais douteux. (j\\'ai dû insister? en plus pour avoir une fourchette en plastique pour le travail)\\n-accompagnement? meilleur chance la prochaine fois. (ou pas) on me sert un spaghetti alfredo sans oignon, bacon, poivre, ou toute chose qui aurais pu le rendre juste acceptable. c\\'était tout simplement sans goût.\\n\\nen résumé : un spaghetti sauce blanche trop cher pas bon. horrible! we were excited to eat here because of the name. however, the hot dogs were dried out and disgusting, buns were dry, and there are no refills on soda. i would suggest walking a couple of doors down to the burger joint. do not order delivery from this place.  the drivers try and pull the oldest trick in the book.  \"i have no change.  you are my first delivery\".    when i went to look for more money since he couldn\\'t provide more change, he started ringing my doorbell over and over.  i was gone less then 10 seconds.  he started yelling at me.  \"i am not the         f$&)ing boss!  i have no change i told you\".  he scared my family.  it was crazy.  i called the restaraunt and was told the owner would call me back.  i never received a call from the owner.  my family was scared that this nut would come back.  stay away from this place ordered 2 larges. one all dressed one plain. received pepperoni instead of plain with giant air pockets. when called back after 10 attempts because their phone lines were busy, i was told that it was a mistake. yes i agree sending me the wrong pizza is a mistake but the cook placing a pizza with giant air pockets in it which is also 2 inches in diameter smaller than the large ordered in the box isn\\'t a mistake, it was intentional. i have posted the picture. replacement pizza arrived 2 hours after my initial order with crust just as bas and ice cold. thank, never will we order here again. got the turkey and cheese sub.  the meat in it was not turkey.   i don\\'t even know what it was.   it had holes throughout and had the consistency of some disgusting canned meat.   almost like dog food.  wish i would have taken a pic.   apparently it must be cheap and that\\'s why they use it.   judging from the other reviews, don\\'t go here! went here at 11:30 on a tuesday, most of their menu was not available. they said they had no toppings except cheese and pepperoni. the woman at the counter was not apologetic or anything. how can you advertise as a top vegas pizza place and only have two types of pizza a half hour after opening?\\n\\ni\\'m vegan and we came here just for the pizza. not to pay for parking, walk all the way in and just get turned away. unacceptable. \\n\\nwe asked if they\\'d have vegan pizza soon and they said \"maybe by dinner time.\"\\n\\ndeserving of zero stars really. here before bucs victory over the cards in game 3 of the nlds, a sunday. game at 4:30, got here at 2:30. packed both inside and out. can\\'t comment on any other time but this really hectic one. \\n\\nordered pepsi and brisket nachos. awful. soggy chips, some shredded beef drenched in sweet generic bbq sauce, a blanket of cold congealed cheese spotted with jalapeño slices. not a degree above room temp. \\n\\nwill give them 1 star for tasty pepsi and keeping it filled. it says it opens from 5pm to 12am so we went there at 11pm the first time but were told they don\\'t accept order anyone(with pretty arrogant attitude)...very disappointed but still we went there last week for the second time: waffle was just so so and the drink was just soda with little fruit slice on the top..the spoons we were provided were blotted and we didn\\'t even use them..they do provide 10% discount if you share their picture on instagram but in all this small benefit cannot offset their bad attitude and unimpressive at all.\\n\\nplus: long waiting time alert: prepared for more than half hour of waiting time awful! everything is loaded with cheese and grease. wish i read the reviews. even lettuce on the caesars salad with light dressing was soft & soggy. go elsewhere!!! the pizza here is horrible. i\\'ve ordered it a few times because it\\'s open 24/7 and let me tell you, it\\'s bad. prices are great, but it doesn\\'t make up for pizza that tastes like left over garbage dump pizza.\\n\\nthe delivery guys will never bring the pizza to my door. they make me walk out of my complex which is quite large. i order delivery for to the door delivery, not walk, balance two pizzas and a 2 liter while trying to type my door code in... no thanks.\\n\\ni also had an issue, which will be my last time dealing with these idiots. i ordered a pizza, it was never delivered, and upper management is refusing to refund my credit card of the charge. they have been giving me the run around on the issue for over two weeks, and now they are flat out ignoring me, and refusing to refund me. dominos is dominos. but when i walk in and order and watch my pizza be ready for 40mins. i had to stand up and ask them to look at the name on the box an hour after i ordered. this dominos is slow. drive 5 miles out of your way if you want it. edit: our soda was flat. seriously go get ian\\'s or drive out of your way for dominos don\\'t go to this one took our son to another kids birthday party here.  i would have never went if i knew they didn\\'t like people to conceal carry.  which by the way is not against the law to carry your gun in.  they can have you trespassed which is a misdemeanor.  games are way over priced.  i was at a competitors a week before.  playing deal or no deal.  it only cost one token.  peter piper is 4 tokens.  the exact same game.  we had a large pepperoni.   15.00 dollars very over priced.  i will say the pizza was good for a place that uses sub par ingredients.    \\n\\n    to summarize they don\\'t support second amendment rights, games way over priced, pizza over priced. \\n     pros it was clean, pizza tasted okay. ordered over the phone the 2 for $5.99. was literally 2 miles away and waited an hour for delivery. when i  opened it up and one item was wrong so i called and was told they would send the correct order to me. then 2 min later the manager called me back to tell us that she had 2 employees that both claim they heard me order what was sent.  basically called to say i was a liar and that she didn\\'t believe me but was going to send it to me anyways. a+ customer service order our sandwiches and they got one of them wrong because it was supposed to be cold. sent it back. we waited 20 minutes for them to remake it because they sent it to the back of the line even though i said we came in before anyone here. so i ask and he\\'s says \"oh you\\'re  still 4 behind\". finally we get the sandwich and it still comes out hot. offered to remake it and i said no i dont feel like waiting at the end of the line again. we end up taking it, but we are not happy with the service we recieved. horrible food and service! the spaghetti was not done...very chewy! my 70 year old mom is disabled and we requested a lower table, not bar seating. there were 8 tables available in the front and more in the back. they said they had reservations for others and could not accommodate us. the manager came up and told us he was sorry but would give us a table within 20 minutes if the tables weren\\'t full. the tables never become full and he never came back to check on us. i will never eat here again. i guarantee this is the worst pizza you could ever get go to the supermarket buy a box of frozen pizza undercook it and there you have it the same taste you will get at this restaurant terrible disgraceful this should never be called the streets of new york because new york\\'s pizza tastes nothing like this it is enormously much better in new york.\\n\\ndon\\'t waste your money eating here i got a $20 off coupon with a purchase of $40. so i decided to give this place another try. last time the food was better but not great. this time the food was really poor quality. i ordered a $15.99 caesar salad, first off if someone pays that much money for a salad the bowl should be full it was 2/3 full, not a big bowl. another thing the lettuce was horrible wilted and black around the edges, gross. the employee who prepared the salad through in the end, gee thanks. \\n\\nwe ordered the fettuccine supremo it tasted flat. not much flavor in the sauce. they used shaved chicken and not much of it. not even a whole breast of chicken. six pieces of broccoli. the noodles were of poor quality. we ordered the small it was $23.99.\\n\\nwe also ordered the garlic bread. it was the best part of the meal. it was made on cheap not fresh white bread. horrible for 10 bucks. \\n\\ni\\'m done with this place! to many other good places to eat in chandler, that use good quality ingredients for less money. they suck big time!!!- don\\'t give ur biz to this store- they r rude, they put u on hold for hours - lmao pretty run of the mill bad pizza. tasted like re heated tombstone or other home made. but the place was clean and the guy behind the counter seemed ok. we went on 7/18 to celebrate two friends birthdays.  the service and our server were horrible.  she had a bitchy attitude.  she seem bother by our group of 12 paying customers.  the food was not that great either.  not coming back. the colonel is dead at this place!!\\' chicken was very dry and overcooked!  walked into the dining area and all the tables were dirty, trash receptacles were all full and overall this place was not clean at all. the floors were sticky and disgusting!!  obviously the manager does not know how to manage this disgusting restaurant!  employees certainly had a no care attitude!! and like the other reviews, our order didn\\'t come out right either!!!please don\\'t eat here!! the food is better than average.  portions are tiny and overpriced.  the service late at night was terrible.  first, the server told us limited menu, then the general manager told us full menu, then the server came back and wouldn\\'t let us order from the full menu.  then the kitchen staff came out & got waited on like kings.  feels like buenos aires (recoleta) inside & trying to be italian, but no idea of how italian restaurants really are. terrible delivery order. fried mushrooms were cold and soggy. forgot the blue cheese for wings. awful man, does this place suck. trust the reviews! i ignored the negative ratings, and that was a mistake. i ordered a large pepperoni and pineapple pizza with extra sauce. what i got: large pizza half pepperoni and half ham & pineapple with \"easy\" sauce?? this place is a joke. drive to a different one - it\\'s worth the gas. stay away.  i\\'m a woman that just experience verbal assault by a sexist manager.\\n\\nthis is the most disturbing experience i\\'ve ever had. they completely messed up our pizza order, took an hour to deliver it then an hour to come back and reimburse us then wanted the whole pizza back as if we should pay for their mistake by not eating.  when we told them we had already eaten some of it they wouldn\\'t reimburse us.\\n\\nwhen i talked to the manager about it he was rude.  he talked over me, when i said this was not very good customer service he said \"so what\".  \\n\\nthe managers name is rick and he\\'s sexist misogynist and a very bad man.  \\n\\nalso the food is terrible. my husband and i have been coming here for about 8 years not sure if it\\'s changed hands but it\\'s still very beautiful inside you welcome with not a smile or a welcome but how many, follow me sit here . you have no choice booth or table .  not good food. food taste frozen, the piano is off tune and the two that play and sang are very horrible. it was the worst date night experience ever, we left after two bites and the music started up. she sang off key, and he played the piano so loud and off key , we could not even hear each other talk. it drove four other young/ middle aged couples out the door before their food came. one couple just ordered drinks sat down and left everything out the door with us. no good to complain owner will tell you your wrong and walks away. very rude place, frozen pre made food. service is horrible. horrible music. left hunger, headaches and disgusted how we were welcomed and how owner/ manager behaved. do not go here save yourself a horrible dinner . ive eaten here twice now. both times were a great disappointment. first time i ordered pizza it was burnt so badly i couldnt eat it. \\nthe second time i ordered the meatballs and pasta. the sauce is so bland it makes store bought taste great ! \\nplease do yourself a huge favor and try one of the many other restaurants in town. you will thank me later. i only gave it a 1 star as it wasn\\'t possible to score it less.  we stopped there for dinner, they weren\\'t very busy, not unusual since it\\'s tuesday.  we ordered a small house salad, with grilled chicken and a personal pizza.  it took over 30 minutes to get the salad.  we finished the salad and was told the pizza would be out soon.  i was drinking ice tea.  the waitress re-filled it, and when i took a sip it wasn\\'t tea - it was coffee.  i told the waitress about it, and her response was they don\\'t service coffee, and got me a fresh drink. at one point a server stopped by to ask if we had our pizza.  forty-five minutes later i went to find her to tell her to bring us our check for the salad, ice tea and soda as we were leaving.  before they brought the check, the pizza arrived - in a to go carton.  i told them we didn\\'t want it, and then we had to wait for the manager to deduct it from our check.  manager never came out - they said they were slow because they had a new cook, yet other, larger tables were being served in less time.  ironically, one of the handicap parking spots in front of the restaurant had a 15 min parking limit.  not sure you could get much in that amount of time.  don\\'t waste your time or money on this place.  you have a choice when you go out to dinner -don\\'t chose this place. mediocre food and absolutely terrible service. other than that a wonderful place! it really is for the old folks, and i\\'m 55! if i didn\\'t have to attend for a function it would have been the last place in monroeville i would have went. went to this place on friday and ordered a dinner salad, pasta with marina and meatballs, and in the middle of the night i woke up with food poisoning. awful customer service. called and made the order, an hour passes by no respond so i call back to check up on it. 1st they said we werent on their order list and then after looking again changed the story to they had cancelled our order because someone showed up to our hotel room and there was no answer (highly doubt it considering the tv and everything else in the room was muted on purpose! :\\\\) and then yet again changed it to the cause being we called them with a different number (as if we didnt know what phone we used to call them) but they really tried making us feel like it was our fault when the error was clearly theirs.\\n\\nafter acknowledging this wasnt getting us anywhere & letting it go of course they realized fault was theirs they left a vm saying the delivery guy will be on the elevator in 5mins and we should go meet him...\\n\\nwhich brings me to my conclusion: would not recommend this place absolute waste of time and you can sense the attitude in their tone. i can see im not the 1st of many negative reviews so if they can channel that consistency of negative service into positives maybe theres still hope! (thats a big maybe) i didn\\'t write this review until now because i felt like our case might have been an anomaly so long ago when we went to cibo for the first and only time. however, a friend has recently gone and had the same major incident.\\n\\nalthough i could write a lot more about my underwhelming experience, the most important part of this review is that cibo does not take allergies with the utmost of seriousness, nor do they train their staff to do so.\\n\\ni have a fatal allergy to nuts, which was clearly communicated to my server. she was meant to order a salad without walnuts, but delivered it with the walnuts and was unapologetic or concerned when i let her know (after taking my first bite). the rest of the evening continued to be a gong show, but to me, this was an extremely important slip-up, one that could cost my life.\\n\\ni just learned last night that a friend of mine ended up in urgent care after a similar experience. it was also their first visit to the restaurant. he is extremely cautious about his nut allergy, so i know that they would have absolutely been forthcoming with their server about it.\\n\\ncibo, please educate your staff about the dangers of food allergies. all other restaurants seem to be well-versed, and often follow-up with a manager\\'s visit to the table (unnecessary, but appreciated). sadly, we will not return to this restaurant, as there are many other choices in the city who consider the health of their patrons their top priority. just got a bad vibe about this place glad something replace the old landing nice to have something close to home. been in about 3 times now most part found the menu to be generic, service is hit and miss. waiting on our food every time we been in we have under cooked, burnt, slow!  \\nmanagement needs a overhaul! had a great waitress she was friendly but heard her get in trouble because our burger was burnt and it took forever to come to the table. she apologized for the delay we told her sorry we complained it was not her fault it was burnt; she not cooking it. \\ngrown up mac and cheese was very good & deep fried pickles were delicious. this is a pizza 73 place with a different name same crap pizza and same horrible wings just like 73 only you pay more money for the pizza here then at 73 and it\\'s the exact same product plus it took them one and half hours to deliver it to my  place 10mins away on a wednesday night i\\'m  being generous with the 1 star rating would not order from here again! food is okay, definitely not as good as it should be for the price. spent 15 on ravioli and only got 5 of them, took over an hour for delivery. only good thing about this place is the bread. i feel bad giving this place such a bad review based on my experience a couple of months ago, and never usually dislike places this much, but here i am.  i am a resident of the bloor/kingsway area in which this restaurant is situated.  now if you know the strip of bloor where this restaurant is, you know that every second place is a restaurant, and they are all pretty busy.  with the selection of restaurants in this area and other italian restaurants in etobicoke (just go to la veranda around the corner!!) i don\\'t know how this place stays open based on my experience.  there is just so much better italian in etobicoke to be had.\\n\\nanyways, i have been here twice.  the first time was something like 2 or 3 years ago with a friend for a casual dinner and i think i may have had a salad or something.  i don\\'t really remember my experience, i just remember i wasn\\'t unhappy with it and generally enjoyed the experience and decor of the restaurant. but this review isn\\'t based on that.\\n\\nso a couple of months ago my boyfriend and i were craving italian and wanted to go somewhere close by.  i wanted to go somewhere new and my boyfriend hadn\\'t been there before.  being a creature of habit, he wanted to go to la veranda around the corner which is an etobicoke failsafe of ours but i insisted on coming to sempre.\\n\\nmy boyfriend went to culinary school and is a sous chef at a very busy italian restaurant in toronto and he really found the menu to be lacking.  he wasn\\'t super hungry and ordered a pizza.  i ordered a pasta (don\\'t remember what it originally was now) which took a super long time to come (even though it wasn\\'t very busy), and when it finally came out i noticed that it really did not seem to match the description of the pasta that i had ordered.  i recall that when giving my order to the waitress she seemed slightly confused with what i had asked for even though what i had ordered was right there on the menu, and i didn\\'t ask for it with any changes or anything.  i recall the pasta i originally had ordered was supposed to have a white sauce and the one i received had a rose sauce, as well as being tortellini.  i was honestly so hungry at that point and not one to complain anyways that i just decided to eat it.  well, if what i had received had turned out to be good i wouldn\\'t have been too unhappy but i honestly would equate the pasta and sauce to some crappy wedding banquet hall food.  the tortellini had no flavour and tasted like something i could have boiled at home from a package from costco.  the pasta was definately not made in house.  the sauce was probably the worst part and made me dislike it so much.  it was just too thick, had no flavour, and just so reminescent of crappy banquet hall food and generally unpleasant.  the pizza was not up to par of what you would expect to find from an italian resto in toronto, had not much sauce and the crust wasn\\'t great.  \\n\\nthere are tons of options along the bloor strip, if you really want italian skip this and go to la veranda around the corner. went here for a birthday party. the hostess when asked about our reservation just told us to go inside rather than show us where our table was. this was especially awkward as we didn\\'t know the other party guests we were meeting, because our friend whose birthday it was hadn\\'t arrived yet. \\n\\nwe ordered our drinks and the waitress seemed nice at first but very cut and dry and seemed only cheerful when talking to us about her sunburn and how she planned to vacation to honduras. \\n\\nfrom then on the service was down hill, my girlfriend had to wait 15 minutes to get a coffee, and then we had to wait another 15 minutes before we could order food and we had to ask to order food. \\n\\nthe music was horrible cheesy euro house music that was blaring and we had to yell to talk to our friends beside us. when we were the only people in the restaurant! haha ridiculous! we asked to have the music turned down, only to have them crank it back up 20 minutes later. \\n\\nordered pasta and it was \"okay\" but obviously made from store bough dry pasta, that you can get at metro next door. i know this from the giant messy pile of pasta boxes literally stacked to the ceiling next to my head where i sat! \\n\\nwe read the pizza was \"good\" so we ordered their signature \" waving flag pizza\" only to get entirely plain sauceless dough that had been in the oven and raw toppings put on after wards. no melted cheese almost zero olive oil. no love put into this pizza whatsoever.\\n\\nthe bruschetta my friends ordered was a joke served on the same overly thin sliced tasteless bread that they toss at you for free when you sit down. \\n\\n\\nwaitress was basically never there to check on us unless we told another server to go get her. \\n\\nwe had to ask 3 times to be brought sparkling water, no parmesean cheese was offered and there was almost zero pepper coming out. \\n\\nwas brought our bill with the tip already added at about 13%. i don\\'t think i would have tipped more than 5% had i been given the option. \\n\\nand given the option, i would also never return! \\n\\nlaughable fake italian restaurants like this don\\'t belong in toronto when there\\'s better places in abundance all around us. something has changed for the worse here.  we are long time regulars and i have to agree with erica v that on the last two pizzas the crust has been soggy / gummy and the sauce was runny / watery even when ordered well done and crispy.  so much so i called the manager last night. this used to be good pizza but sadly no longer. they\\'ve either changed ingredients, recipes and/or chefs.  last week\\'s sausage pizza tasted like bagged hospital grade meat. i always get good pizza from here. \\n\\ntonight i called in my order and drove down to wait for it. as i was sitting waiting in front of the big glass window,  a driver pulls up, walks in and when the other guys went to the back he grabbed some chicken pieces and shoved it in his mouth. then he proceeded to stick every one of his fingers into his mouth up to his knuckles. i\\'m not exaggerating. then he wipes his mouth with the same hand. then his nose, then he did his fingers again. then his nose again. and his fingers one last time. \\n\\n i thought he would at least wash his hands, but then he grabbed someones wings then he took a pizza did something with it then put the order out for pick up. i walked in real quick and asked the guy who just walked up to the counter if that order is mine, he said no i said good because if that is mine i don\\'t want it. i told him what happened and he told the guy to wash his hands..... i feel bad for the people who had this guy deliver their food tonight around 6:15pm. yuck we went to bannock yesterday april 2016. the food was bland. service was fine. however, the manager told us they had a reservation on our table when there were empty tables and none had \"reserved\" on them. this was after we paid promptly and was still chatting. so that means don\\'t pay or you will be pressured to leave. when i got home, my friend messaged me. we both had tummy problems and i had a vegetarian meal. cross-contamination? needless to say i am not going back. there are too many restaurants in toronto to be asked to leave after paying. train your staff properly on how to treat customers. ***warning!!!!!*** this place is horrible!  why?  here it is.  my family and i went to this place saturday evening based on the reviews here on yelp and other sites such as urbanspoon.  4 of us ordered chicken parmesan, a pretty good yardstick for determining how the food is in any italian restaurant.  after each of us took our first bite, we all lookedvat each other with the sort of face you make when you are wondering what was that.  the look was followed by universal disdain for this so called meal.  the chicken was inedible , the sauce was nothing resembling tomato sauce found on 99% of all italian meals.  we should have been tipped off when the chicken was grilled not breaded as is the case with this dish.  bland.  gross.  terrible.  now comes the part that totally caused me to write this.  we sent it all back.  we were asked \"would you like something else?\".  not a chance.  if this was the indicator for the so called cuisine we wanted nothing to do with it.  the \"manager\" came to our table.  \"you have to pay for the entire meal\".  seriously?  seriously!  now again in 99% of the time when food is returned, the normal proper way of doing business is to say \"sorry you didn\\'t like your food.  we will deduct the cost from your bill\".  ladies and gentlemen.  in the face of protecting my family from the embarassment of the police being called, i paid $83 for this crap. $83!!!  as i left i suggested the manager change this policy.  it was met with a smirk and defiance.  in the face of my saying the social media world will hear about this, she couldn\\'t care less.  so, here it is. for those of you who gave this place a positive review, i have to ask \"seriously?\". for those of you looking for something new in italian food in charlotte,you have been warned by someone who rarely sends food back and by someone who understands the customer is always right. terrible experience. hip hop music so loud my wife and i couldn\\'t even speak...\\nin an italian restaurant...come on...\\nordered a meatball for an appetizer...worst value for my money ever!\\nyou get one meatball that is too salty and flavorless for 13.45\\nthen you have to feel like an honour for the waitress to bring out a few slices of bread.\\nhalf priced mojito that doesn\\'t look or taste like a mojito.\\ninexperienced staff in training overall makes me never return to this place again.\\nmuch better places out there...\\ncan\\'t wait to get home and put some relaxing music on...take a few aspirins...my head is spinning!! id give it no stars if i could...food was awful. pizza was soggy and flavor was uninspired and flat. the wings were the worst wings i\\'ve ever had...overcooked, and tasted old, threw them away after eating one. i never throw away food. buyer beware!!!! the food was barely palatable. we ordered the spaghetti and meat sauce. mushy noodles, pasty sauce and chewy meat. we also got the chicken alfredo. this dish was worse. they used spaghetti noodles instead of fettuccine noodles. the sauce was like eating pasty cheesy dough. the chicken was almost crunchy. my husband had a stomach ache after the food. i didn\\'t because i really didn\\'t eat but a couple of bites. the salad and garlic bread were fine. first time trying this restaurant. it\\'s pretty bad, expensive and the dishes taste like plastic. a last resort only, well, maybe you\\'re better off with convenience store snacks instead. salads are garnished with all types of peppers not mentioned on the menu. caesar is laughable. mixed lettuce with peppers, assorted veggies and a few parmesan shavings do not a caesar make. design your own pasta was warmed up pasta with a bland sauce. crispy crust on the pizza was anything but. dessert cake was pre-manufactured and tasted full of chemicals, making me wonder exactly how long it had been in their fridge. very disappointing, as was the 87 dollar bill before tip for lunch for three people. do not!!!!! order through romano\\'s pizzeria. horrific customer service. i was told that i would not be refunded my $20 order...  for my extremely cold pizza that they said was fresh out the oven. the pizza felt like it had been sitting out for a few hours ... that\\'s absolutely disgusting.... the manager refused to refund me $20... \\ni waited in my car with my 2 month old new born for almost an hour!!!! to get an extremely cold disgusting pizza. again what horrific customer service. we had to buy an alboa pizza to sastify our  pizza craving...  i would highly recommend not ordering through this disgusting horrific cold gross pizza place. they don\\'t care about what they serve you. & again the customer service was absolutely terrible!!!!! my pooor new born child having to wait in the car for over an hour because they didn\\'t have their times right. for a disgusting cold pizza that not even my dog would eat. if you want awful gross pizza then this is your place ... other then that spend your money elsewhere. would never recommend this place to anyone!!!!! in this lifetime. my family has been coming here for years. no manager on duty tonight. all the kid (workers ) are playing around behind the counter. order was wrong. they forgot the sausage on the pizza.  fixed it by putting sausage on a cold pizza and putting it back in the oven. when you lifted a slice it all rolled off......nice. manager would have done it right. bread was day old, salad dressing was good but salad was over dressed.\\nshrimp was nice size but tasted pre cooked, angel hair pasta was not drained well, no flavor and the lasagna was inedible. my dog food was pre cocked this place is expense and so gross will be out of business in no time this place gathers a whole other type of crowd to please for cheap eats . it\\'s dirty and dingy not good food. it\\'s a cheap buffet at best. i can\\'t seem to find myself even touching the door handle let alone the countless times the serving utensils have been touched with kids who wipe  noses on their shirt sleeves. ..ugh! bad, bad service or actually none.   was ignored totally when tried to go in for lunch. i came in to the restaurant at 4:30pm. it was mostly empty, however the service was slow and inattentive. \\n\\ni ordered the clam pizza and am sorry i did. the only clams on the pizza were 1-2 still in the shell on each slice. you had to scrape them out yourself. i would rather eat my pizza rather than work for it. furthermore, this resulted in very little crab meat on the pizza. lastly, there were clam shells broken off and melted into the pizza. they were hard to see. thus, there were 2-3 bites i literally has to spit out as i was chewing clam shells. \\n\\nwhen i pointed this out to the waitress amanda she said sorry and she would tell the chef. she even admitted that this was not the first time this has happened. despite my complaint there was not an offer to deduct a portion of the bill or offer of free dessert or something to compensate. \\n\\ndisappointing. just got delivery from here and wtf... ordered the half sheet pizza and at some point it was evidently sideways from there to here. we got 2 toppings on one side, 2 on the other and when we opened it, about 1/4 of the pizza was \"mine\" as the other ingredients had slid over. this in itself might not be a problem - i could maybe give it an \"eh, whatever,\" but then in taking 2 bites, i knew that for how greasy the pizza was, if i ate it my digestive system would be in for a cleansing if you know what i mean. \\n\\ni called them back and said i wanted my credit card refunded. she had to call the owner. the driver promptly came back with a \"transaction voided\" receipt and i was told that the amount would be credited to my account within 2-3 business days. oh, and incidentally, they even asked us to return the 2 liter of soda - so we had to pour it back into the bottle from our glasses. i should have said i was keeping it for the inconvenience, but you know, whatever. \\n\\nneedless to say i will not be ordering from nunzio\\'s again. worst service. some guy barely understood our order or address for delivery. he said we\\'d have our delivery in 35 minutes. we are still waiting over an hour. each time we call he\\'s rude and hangs up. don\\'t bother with this place. bad, unprofessional service! is this chinese food or really the lowest grade products around. the food was horrible. with every bite you could taste the poor quality. never again. i will preface my negative review by saying that i reached out to cibo on saturday morning (oct 22) the day after my experience. as of the 27th, i have not heard back from them. here\\'s how it went down.\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0we arrived around 8:10 for our 8:00 reservation, which is definitely our bad. but since we didn\\'t see a server until 8:20, it obviously wasn\\'t a huge deal. i do not know our server\\'s name, as he never introduced himself, welcomed us to cibo, or even said hello. he never even smiled, now that i think about it. basically, he just asked for a drink order. when it came time to place our dinner order, we had to ask him about the features of the evening, which maybe he forgot to tell us, who knows. i ordered a bruschetta, and the rotisserie feature, and my girlfriend ordered a burrata and the ravioli. there were seven of us dining, and the server didn\\'t write anything down. not a good sign. after about five minutes our server came back and told my girlfriend that the pumpkin ravioli was actually gone, and that she \"needs to order something else.\" about 20 minutes later, the server returned to the table to ask if anyone would like another glass of wine, and then said to my girlfriend, and i quote, \"did you wanna order some food?\" she asked for the gnocchi instead of the ravioli. at this point, every water glass on the table had been empty for approximately 30 minutes, as we\\'re now approaching 9:00pm. my girlfriend\\'s gnocchi came out around 9:15, which was okay, but the garlic was definitely burnt. as we approached 9:30, i still didn\\'t have my rotisserie feature. perhaps it\\'s partially my fault for not inquiring earlier as to the whereabouts of my food, but i do my best to be as easy to serve as possible when our server was clearly very busy; likely why everyone\\'s water glasses were empty for almost our entire meal. at approximately 9:45 our server came back to the table and asked if we\\'d like anything else, and at that time my girlfriend asked our server to simply cancel my rotisserie feature. he gasped, and admitted that he, \"totally forgot to even ring it in.\" he followed that up by asking me rhetorically, \"how did i not notice you didn\\'t have any food?\" he then asked if i\\'d like anything else off the menu, or if i\\'d like another glass of wine. i declined and just asked for the bill, since everyone at our table was long finished their meals.\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0i\\'m not so concerned that the server forgot my entrée, because we all make mistakes, and in my years of serving tables i\\'ve forgotten a ton of things. it happens. my issues were with his demeanor, and how the situation was handled. how does a server not even smile? i\\'ve spent years of my life in restaurants, and i\\'ve never seen a server so unwelcoming. i\\'ve literally had better service ordering a taquito at 7-11. on top of this, no visit from a manager to the table, nothing comped from the bill, not even our first round of drinks were taken care of. the server quietly gave me a gift card for next time for $25, which is not even the price of the entrée that i ordered and never received. so all in all, i was handed a bill for $82, and i didn\\'t even have dinner. well, after all the good reviews, i was really looking forward to eating at chicago joe\\'s.  i am from chicago and was married to an italian.  i love italian food,  and am considered quite a good cook.  the place is cute, and packed to the gills by 6:00, which we considered a good sign, even tho you would hardly recognize it as a restaurant from the outside.  \\n\\nthere was only one waiter for the back half of the restaurant where we were sitting, and he worked his buns off.  while overall we were there 1-1/2 hours,  we never felt ignored.  i started off with the snails in mushrooms, which were plentiful and pretty good.  a few too many crumbs in the sauce for my taste, but overall, good.  my husband had the roasted peppers for appetizer, and they were just that.  a plate of roasted green and red bell peppers with a little cheese on top.  good, but better as an accompaniment for something else.  we were served warm bread, which we did use to sop up the sauces from the snails and peppers.\\n\\ni had the pasta fagioli soup next, and it was a thick as library paste.  i ate a couple of bites, and that was all i could take.  my husband had a salad, which was nothing special altho fresh, and he said the vinegar and oil dressing was very good.  i tasted the little container of garlic dressing they gave him, and it was delicious.\\n\\ni ordered meat lasagna for my entrée, which should be a safe bet in an italian restaurant.  however, it was the poorest excuse for lasagna i have ever eaten.  there was almost no ricotta in the dish, over baked and dry, a couple of lasagna noodles with some kind of cheese between them and tons of overcooked, dry ground beef.  it was also very bland.  i didn\\'t eat it.\\n\\nmy husband got one of the nightly specials, chicken pepperoncini,  with pasta on the side.  he ate it and said it was okay, but not spectacular.  \\n\\ni was really glad that we went there with a coupon from restaurant.com, so we got a decent discount.  it is not an inexpensive restaurant. there were 4-5 veal dishes on the menu, and they were all $32.95.  they added 18% tip to our bill because of the coupon, and i didn\\'t begrudge that at all, because the waiter did a great job with all the people he had to serve.\\n\\nwe may try it again sometime, because with so many people eating there, there must be a reason.  so maybe we just ordered the wrong things.  however, as i said, you have to wonder about an italian restaurant that can\\'t make lasagna. this is pretty bad pizza. we ordered because it could be delivered to hotel  ...tastes like cardboard very light on toppings...i would never order again. i think it might be frozen digorno. the salads were lettuce w three tomato slices..some of lettuce was turning. i\\'ve been here a number of times just because it\\'s convenient. never have been impressed with anything (especially not the service), but i never had much of a reason to complain. until today...\\ni decided to give their chef salad a whirl. after the uncomfortable transaction with the lady at the register that refuses eye contact or even the slightest acknowledgment of your existence as a customer, i waited anxiously for the salad i so inconsiderately requested. when the time came, i shoved my way to the front of the line like a maga hat wearer at a trump rally and clutched my prized salad with complete caution as i made my way back to my tiny, cramped table. upon initial inspection, i felt like i had been done right by the bountiful portions of deli meat the rinaldi\\'s gods had bestowed upon me. after three bites i realized the roast beef was still bleeding. like, bleeding.... i haven\\'t seen that much raw meat since the first time i saw a peter north film (see pic for meat reference). i didn\\'t bother to complain or ask for a refund. i figure i\\'d be better off never going back and flushing the $40-50 a month i spend down an actual toilet would be better for me.  long story short, if you need a reason to take a day off work to nurse your b-hole and don\\'t mind feeling like one when you patronize small business, this is the place. but if you appreciate good gut-health and basic customer service skills, avoid this place like walmart after 10 pm... if there was a way to give this place a \"minus stars\" i would.  i took my mother for mother\\'s day brunch and i have to say this was by far the worst food i have ever eaten.  i was so embarrassed having subjected my elderly mother to such slop.  the food was inedible.  not even the dessert was good.  it is criminal to charge money for such poor quality food.  don\\'t bother wasting your time and money.  worst food in calgary ... hands down.  yuck! ordered and picked up two pizza\\'s tonight, asked for extra sauce on them. no extra sauce on either and didn\\'t get much cheese on one of them that was suppose to be half cheese half sausage. called and spoke to saba the manager and he said it was my fault for ordering extra sauce, \"the cheese sucked up the sauce\". what?! refused to replace. never had this problem before. not worth $45 i spent for two pizza\\'s. so yeah, i\\'m reviewing a chain. i wanted to try the \"new and improved\" domino\\'s pizza. everything those commercials said about their old pizza was true-- cardboard crust, ketchup sauce, bad toppings. so, is the new domino\\'s better than the old? \\n\\nyes, but that\\'s not saying much-- it moves up from negative stars to 1, perhaps1.5 stars. the cheese and toppings are much improved. the cheese abundant and tasty and the mushrooms were thickly sliced whole brown mushrooms. really good. the sauce was a bit salty and bland-- not horrible, but nothing to write home about. \\n\\nthey still have a problem with the crust. the crust on both mediums we ordered was mushy and underdone. while it wasn\\'t as blatantly offensive as old domino\\'s crust, it still had a lingering aftertaste like those bisquick pancakes mom used to try to feed us in the 1970s. add to that an abundant dusting of garlic salt and you\\'ve got a taste reminiscent of your first boyfriend\\'s attempt to make you an \"italian\" dinner with garlic bread. i had no idea they even made garlic salt any more. it hasn\\'t improved. \\n\\nso, the pizza has improved, but not enough for me to ever eat it again. i normally order pizza from this location on a regular basis. i would carry out but this was my 1st time having it delivered...i completed my order at 7:00 it was confirmed on the delivery tracking that the order would be delivered at 7:37 well i did not get my order until 8:15. almost 40 mins after the tracker staled that i would have my food. the pizza was cold and my wings were under cooked. i called the establishment and was told i could get a free pizza :( the manager stated that she would used this as a coaching opportunity for her drivers. honestly that is not my issue. it will be a while before i return here. seriously the worst service i have ever got in my life . we called in to order a pizza and the kid on the phone couldn\\'t even figure out how to take my order then i told them 3 different times we had cash and to please bring change for it . you think they brought change ? nope they tried to give us change back as if we were tipping the kid 20$ for the delivery . 3 timesssss i told them .  horrible cold pizza too i will never eat with pizza hut ever again . ever!!! went in for lunch, looked good so i ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza, and some garlic parmesan fries. they burned the pizza and under cooked the fries. but to top it off, the order came to $10.27(pricy but whatever its vegas), and i gave them a dollar tip (wrote on the reciet and even totaled it out for them). when i went to check my bank account, they charged me $12.32... i hate to be anal about one dollar, but they did not deserve it and it was blindly taken from me, from right under my nose. the woman cashier was nice but the gentleman cook seemed like an asshole and gave me a sassy look when i asked for a side of ranch. no mention of the ranch costing extra or anything.. i would of paid for it.. assuming it cost a dollar.. i guess i did pay for it. whatever, last time i visit them. ordered a antipasto chopped salad. . what  i received was a box of old lettuce and absolutely no meat or veggies. . really? ?? terrible service, i waited more than an hour and half but when i call the manager said they didnt even get the order.  but i have been charged. you guys should check your bank account when not delivery has not made. they charged even though they didnt deliver, they never say \" please\" \" sorry\" words to customers about what they have mistake. they have to learn how to treat customer before running business. im going to cut my hand off myself if i call them again. worst place in my life. one star because i can\\'t tell you if the pizza is any good because every time i call they put me on hold.  first time 10min so figured they forgot i was on hold. so hung up &  called back when they asked if they could put me on hold i said no &  they put me on hold anyway. i\\'ve probably been here 10-12 times over the years. my kids love it, particularly the sugar puff dessert. i\\'ve never had a great meal but on several occasions i\\'ve had a dissatisfactory one. today was the worst. i ordered a grilled chicken salad (no banana peppers). the salad arrived with the banana peppers. since someone from the back delivered it he probably didn\\'t realize i had ordered it without them but nbd i just pulled them out. in doing that i saw two fruit flies - one swarming above the dish and one literally crawling around the edge of the plate. i understand that happens so just shoo\\'ed them away and tried to pretend it didn\\'t happen. the red onions were all slimy/ like mush. the chicken seemed fine so i decided to just eat that (since server was no where to be found anyway) and avoid the salad. when she did come over to see if i wanted a box i let her know about the flies and that the salad didn\\'t seem fresh. she said \"ew gross! sorry!\" and then went to get the bill.  she\\'s right.  gross. and now tonight i feel sick and have to wonder if it was the chicken that i paid $11.50 for that made me sick... \\ntruly no need to go here. i won\\'t be back. we still have a groupon for $50- free to anyone who wants to take the risk to go here to eat slimy onions, fruit flies and questionable chicken. i like guys. but when you say you\\'re delivery time is 1.5 hours (ridiculous) and you don\\'t deliver it for 3 hours. that\\'s absolutely unacceptable. won\\'t be ordering from here again. surprisingly tasteless. it was as if they didn\\'t add salt to anything. the dough had wood fired marks but no wood fired taste. it also just didn\\'t taste. there was no sense of yeast. the mushrooms and pepperoni also were bland. i was very disappointed. visited time square neighborhood restaurant and was very disappointed in the willingness to turn away business when they have been open for a few weeks.  my wife and my son were planning visiting and watching some basketball when we were informed that no one under 21 allowed in lounge area.  we were not sitting at the bar but tables adjacent to them.  when asked why that was it was due to a rule made by management of time square.  there are numerous great restaurants that don\\'t have the \"prima donna\" attitude of time square.  i understand that some will welcome the area not be available to children.  what about people like me that want an area where no drunken idiots are allowed but they don\\'t have that yet.  they definitely should not have \"neighborhood\" in their title as i did not feel welcome. regular bar food in bar atmosphere. tried to b hip but no go. service extremely average. server didn\\'t even introduce herself.  don\\'t bother going. many other better choices including oreganos pizza. i was in town for the weekend from washington, dc to celebrate my friend\\'s 30th birthday. we had dinner here before heading out for a night of celebration - i opted for the beef short rib. \\n\\nwhile eating, i was less than impressed with the flavor profile. i thought maybe it was because i am spoiled by the dc restaurant scene - i only completed half of the meal. within an hour of consuming the meal, i realized i had food poisoning. i was violently ill for the next eight hours, had to pass on celebrating my friend\\'s birthday that i came into town for and instead spent it with my head in the toilet. \\n\\nit is interesting to read some of the other reviews stating that lago has a very high amount of health code violations - not surprised. \\n\\nadditionally, my friend\\'s husband had a pizza with some of the same meat on it (much smaller amount than my meal). he suffered from some of the same symptoms on a less severe level as mine. \\n\\njust my experience, eat at your own risk.\\nb\\n\\nps, here are all of the health code violations (click right, there are over 30): http://www.cleveland.com/datacentral/index.ssf/2016/07/find_ohio_restaurant_inspectio.html?appsession=16012723090076720557387043116441873242689634337233748355385623392227642717882018813140842838815487639001555215132924799686270628&recordid=22882&pageid=8&prevpageid=2&cpipage=1&cpisorttype=&cpiorderby=&cbcurrentrecordposition=15&mod0linktodetails=true the food was ok, a little overpriced. service was good. they advertise happy hour come to find out it wasn\\'t the day we were there. if i could make a suggestion it would be to advertise the specials for the day it is.... why would i care about the specials for next week..?  also the place is pretty crowded. maybe a few less tables inside. if you go you\\'ll see what i\\'m talking about. i\\'ll probably pick another place next time. very rude. i asked for delivery, when they delivered they messed up. i called back and they told me that it wasn\\'t worth their time to fix their mistake. then they tried to make it sound like i was in the wrong! \\npizza dough tasted frozen, very chewy. not ordering from there again one star is just for the ability to post this...i wish i had read some of the other delivery reviews prior to ordering, but caliente had messed up my orders in small ways twice in the past. the first they forgot my dressing and one of the minor vegetables was missing from my salad. i could overlook it. the second time i ordered the delivery was beyond the estimated wait time. this time, i waited 10 minutes beyond the estimated delivery time to call the restaurant to ask where the food was. they purposely picked up the phone and hung it up on me three or four times. when a girl with a bad attitude finally picked up they told me my order was out for delivery, and it wasn\\'t, because it took another 20 minutes to get to me (1.5hrs later), and i live less than 5 minutes away! when i finally went to meet the delivery boy he seemed under the influence of something...slurred, slow speech, and delayed response time. what he gave me did not seem to be all of the food, and i told him to wait...sure enough one of my items was completely missing, and when i brought the rest in, it was cold as ice, and completely unenjoyable. i am now waiting for the rest of it to show up, but i\\'m doubtful i will see it because he assured me they \\'were closing early\\' tonight. i\\'ll never order from them again. absolutely terrible customer service, and cold, missing food certainly isn\\'t what anyone orders for. plenty of other good delivery places to try in the same area , i\\'m sure. they need to get their acts together. it\\'s embarassing. screw this place. clearly run in a mishmash idiotic way.  went here and apparently they had the entire place rented out for a wedding party or something, which is already idiotic. who rents the entire restaurant?  it\\'s not like they didn\\'t have other tables or space, they just had a sign on the door saying the place was booked until 8.  as we are reading the sign, some lady comes running out and tells us we can\\'t eat until 8 (it\\'s 715) like we were carrying plague if we entered the building.\\n\\nso i go online to book something and everything is unavailable online all night.  so i call, and they tell me 845, even though they just told me that we could eat at 8 at the door.  also, clearly at 730 i could see that the parties inside were not going anywhere by 8...were they supposed to just magically vanish?  \\n\\ni could have waited 30 minutes and demanded to be seated at 8 like i was told at first, but who wants to fight to give a place your money?  also, i sure hope that wedding party was local and will all be coming back regularly because i sure won\\'t be.  \\n\\nalso from reading other reviews, it appears the managing of reservations and professionalism can be an issue here.  no thanks.  nothing i hate more than working to hand you my money.  you aren\\'t a caterer, so renting out your entire place part of the night is absurd, even more so when you could accommodate more people.  if you are just full from normal reservations, that\\'s one thing.  how about posting on your website you booked the whole place tonight?  \\n\\nif you don\\'t have the staff, then get rid of the other empty tables.  in addition, get your staff on the same page... actually you know what? don\\'t bother. i don\\'t care. won\\'t be back.  i hate reviewing places when i don\\'t actually get to try them, but since my experience was enough to never return, it\\'s enough for me. ok, so i\\'ve been ordering from this location for months now and each time the delivery service is getting worse. im at the point that i will not order from then anymore and will not tell anyone of my family or friends to order from them ever after today. i ordered their $25 coupon of 2 large 2 topping pizzas and 20 wings today. i placed this order at 12:35 pm and as told it would take an hour for delivery(which seemed a bit excessive at this time of day. since it was after lunch rush). so as the hour mark came and then went the order was still not here. at 20 minutes after the hour it was still not here, so i called them to ask where my order was since its now been an hour and 20 minutes. the girl on the phone proceeds to go on to tell me that the order was out for delivery and quickly got off the phone. so again i sat outside waiting and again another 10 minutes went by and no order. i called back again and this time the girl put me on hold to see where the delivery girl was at. she came back on the line and tried to tell me that there was traffic that delayed the driver and that she was less then 5 minutes away. now that began to irritate me since they are only 3 miles from where i live. there\\'s not that much traffic that would delay a delivery by 30 minutes. the girl just kept saying she was sorry and never offered up any comps of any kind to show any customer appreciation to keep me as a customer. i then asked her what they were going to do to compensate me for not having my food by an hour and a half. she then says oh well i can give you a $10 credit on your account for your next order. i said fine and hung up expecting my order in under 5 minutes as they claimed. well that was a lie yet again as it took the driver an additional 12 minutes to finally show up. so now its been an hour and 42 minutes; the driver got out and acted like nothing was wrong. she asked \"hi how\\'s your day going?\" i responded with \"it would have been better if my order was here over 40 minutes ago, on time.\" she then got very snotty quick and snapped \"well there\\'s only one of me and your total is $30.58.\" i said \"well i would like to check to see if my food was still hot before i pay for it.\" she pulled out one pizza and handed it to me and i checked it. granted it wasnt as hot as all my other orders from before but it was warm enough that i went ahead and paid for it. i then handed the driver $40 and she said \"let me get your change.\" the change should have been $9.42 she came back and handed me only $9 not even saying sorry i don\\'t have any change, change she just assumed she could keep the 42 cents and hesitated like i was going to give her more for a tip.  well now i\\'m seeing red so that\\'s all she got as her tip was the 42 cents she assumed she could just keep and i walked away from her. this whole delivery was the worse experience i have ever had from this place. they acted as though my order didn\\'t matter in any way. they acted like they were irritated with me for being upset for not having my food for over and hour and 40 minutes. it will be awhile before i order from them again if i do decide to. i ordered sophia pizza and i was expecting a delicious food with proper spice. what i ended up eating was testing horrible , super spicy which burned my mouth. i couldn\\'t even have the second slice. the funny thing is we checked the menu to see if there was any indication of the spiciness of the food! no! nothing . i\\'m assuming they just dropped the bottle of pepper in the pizza hoping no one will notice. bad service and never enough cheese pizza, this place used to be good but it\\'s gone downhill. horrible! and i don\\'t mean the food.  i cannot comment on the food because i never received it.  2hrs after ordering, 2 phone calls from the driver who seemed incoherent at best, and 15 minutes of standing outside and we have no dinner.  oh, and there was the \"manager\" hanging up on me.  yeah, that was fun.  no, i did not yell or curse or lose my temper. but i still got hung up on. really hoping they do as they said and cancel the credit card transaction because i have no desire to deal with this business again! i have been a frequent patron of this location awhile now.  fortunately, the one constant that this location has is a gentleman by the name of russ.  we have had a couple of bad experiences with other servers here, but he went above and beyond to ensure that we would come back.  you don\\'t see this kind of service at a casual dining establishment.  i learned today that he moved on, with this being the case, my wife and i will not being going back to this location any longer.  the owners of this streets need to bring him back at all costs. i ordered there brooklyn style philly cheese steak pizza. i asked for them to put the  garlic crust but i guess the forgot. when i opened up my pizza box i was extremely disappointed  there was little to no meat on the pizza litterly only about two slices had meat on a large pizzs... wtf i did order a philly cheese stake.  know $23 latter and still dissatisfied.\\nwith so many other pizza options around idk if i will be back. sad service and at the bar with only 4 others taking up bar chairs. dropping my food on the floor of course was an accident however letting me wait nearly 20 minutes before i had to ask for another beer is ridiculous. how was my food? she wouldn\\'t know because she didn\\'t ask. \\nfriday\\'s is still going downhill. over-priced food with poor presentation. perfect example of an egotistical owner who thinks the place is perfect and refuses to improve even after customer complaints. their solution? force the staff to right fake glowing reviews. pathetic. avoid at all costs. they won\\'t be around for long anyway. i love oregano\\'s...90% of the time. but last night at this location i was soured. i ended up with food poisoning this morning. i won\\'t go into details about the level of poisoning to save all who read this. \\n\\ni called the store this morning and spoke to a rude little manager named natalie. i didn\\'t want my money back or anything at all. when i told her what was going on two things happened that made me furious.\\n\\n1. \"well, no one else has reported being sick so maybe it\\'s just a bug you caught.\"\\n2. \"what do you want me to do about it? it\\'s not like i can really do anything.\" she even went so far as to say that all good born illness takes at least 24 hours to come up. really?! do you have a food handler\\'s card?!?! it doesn\\'t take that long in most cases. at minimum she should have to take that test again! \\n\\ni used to work at the scottsdale and shea store. no manager who wanted to keep their job would ever be so snarky with a guest! and they would never try to blame said customer and blow them off. \\n\\ni simply tried to let them know and she was basically a word i can\\'t  say here! \\n\\ni won\\'t go back here. i was taught to take care of the guest. maybe she needs some lessons....\\n\\nemailed who i was told to email and i called\\ncorporate...no response. just dined here this evening. i have to say this place had hands down the worst service i have ever received. party of 3 adults, the server suggested we order 3 pizzas and an appetizer. we were not interested in their limited appetizer menu so we decided to skip it and ordered the pizzas. it took 45 minutes to get the food, i know they bake it fresh so i was willing to wait but the pizzas were bland and overpriced. and we had 1 and 3/4 pizza left, her suggestion of 3 pizzas was far too much food. honestly, i would skip this one. unbelievable!!!! returned after a terrible visit!!! to be treated worse!!! great sauce!!!! never again for me!!!!! you would expect a restaurant to maybe give a damn about what people think.  i sent an email to them, right after posting my review.  if you are interested in getting/keeping customers, you might consider replying to an email, with an explanation, and apology... anything.  shows me you think a lot of yourselves, that you don\\'t need to worry about an individual client.  \\n\\nconsidering the restaurant was empty on a saturday night, i might reconsider that position. i love oreganos, this restaurant is one of my favorite places to go for a quick bite. the reason for the one star review is for the awful service given to my friend and myself. the server\\'s name is josh. he was rude from the moment we sat down and he greeted us. when i commented on his rude behavior, he told me that i could leave. sorry but maybe he should leave, the whole service industry! we got forgotten and waited over an hour. it was not that busy but their disorganized seating structure allowed for a bunch of folks to get seated before us. very frustrating! we are not sure if we will come back. i found ventura grill from groupon and used the $16 groupon that allowed us to choose 2 breakfast entrees (up to a $9.29 value each) and 2 drinks (up to a $15 value each, can be used for alcohol). my husband and i brought our 2 small children with us and ordered the 2 breakfast entrees, which we planned to share with the kids since they don\\'t eat a lot all at once.\\n\\n my husband got one of their scrambles and i got the pancakes with the berry topping, which was advertised an additional charge above the pancake cost but still well under the $9.29 maximum per entree. my husband ordered a beer and i ordered a mimosa to go along with our breakfast and we ordered the kids each a chocolate milk.\\n\\nit did take a while to receive our meals but that doesn\\'t bother me unless its a completely unreasonable amount of time. what bothered me was once we got the bill and showed the waitress the groupon, she had counted our kids chocolate milks as the \"drinks\" that went along with the meal and did not apply the berry topping charge as part of my \"meal\\'! \\n\\nthe groupon advertises $16 for up to $48 and change worth of food and drink...our total discount was $2.22 after the $16 paid for the groupon was considered! the waitress refused to let us separate the chocolate milks from the drinks so that the drinks with alcohol could appropriately be applied to the groupon.\\nthe waitress knew we had a groupon to begin with and she said nothing about how it would be applied. it is unbelievable to me that a business would even think about cheating customers out of a few dollars!! it makes no sense! \\n\\nnow they have 4 fewer customers and i would not recommend this place to anyone. what matters most to me in a business is that they are honest and that their primary goal is to provide quality service and product to customers and help them get the most for their money. i am willing to overlook a lot of other things if this is still true of a business.\\n\\nin the case of ventura grill, they are neither honest nor do they have quality service or product and the waitress was definitely not interested in helping us get the most for our money. terrible service and i had to force my kids to eat the pancakes, they tasted so bland! not even the syrup could make up for the lack of flavor.\\n\\nand i also have to add, this is the first review i have ever written. that is how bad of a taste this restaurant left in my mouth both physically and figuratively speaking. my last visit\\n\\nplaced a \"to go\" order 3 small pizzas, 2 with pepperoni and 1 with pepperoni and sausage, all with asiago flavored crust. i walked in to hungry howies to pick up my order and the restaurant was empty.  however, it still took over 5 minutes for an employee to acknowledge i was there and  to get my order. \\n\\nthe pizza honestly was one of the worst take-out pizzas i have ever had from hungry howies and the order wasn\\'t even correct. i wish i would have looked at my order prior to leaving the store.  i called hungry howies to let them know that not only was the pizza not very good but my order wasn\\'t correct.  the associate who answered the phone response was \"sorry bout that, not sure who cooked it.  i guess we can cook another\".  after waiting another 20 minutes to cook another pizza i head back up to hungry howies and yes, once again my order wasn\\'t correct (wrong flavor crust). since i wasn\\'t willing to wait another 20 minutes i took the pizza and headed home.\\n\\nmy previous experiences with hungry howies has always been hit or miss. i think i will drive a little further to one of the many other pizza places in my area. bring back the prairie grain salad!!! byob.  expensive.  bad food.  bad service.  great atmosphere.  good location.\\n\\ni\\'m sorta sad this place didn\\'t burn down when the restaurant next door burnt down.  it is a shame because that next door restaurant was better in every single way except atmosphere. as a native chicagoan i grew up going to giordano\\'s  as well as the other top chicago style pizza joints.  i know good chicago pizza - this is not it!  the pizza was undercooked and frankly gross.  my husband, myself and my daughter could not eat it.  we even thew out our leftovers the moment we got home.  they are doing chicago style pizza a disservice.  the chopped salad was delicious.  the mozzarella triangles were great.  the wait for a table was minimal.  the wait for the pizza was 45 mins as expected.  the restaurant was nice.  the staff was nice.  the high chair was even clean (harder to find then you think).  but if a pizza place can\\'t put out amazing pizza, nothing else matters. a couple weeks ago, my friends and i arrived in phoenix, starving, at about 1am with a 12 hour layover. we shuttled to a motel and discovered our only options were jack in the box drive-thru (no car) and gus\\'s. i\\'m not going to credit this place with an elaborate review. i didn\\'t know pizza could taste this bad. i mean how do u mess up a pizza. i am not a food critic and i am not picky by any means. my friend could only stomach two slices and he can eat! the pizza was flavorless, tasted like water just like one other reviewer mentioned and upon swallowing, the cardboard box seemed the more edible of the two. i\\'m not even kidding. \\ni must also mention the price. i know beggars can\\'t be choosers. i don\\'t mind paying out the ear for a edible meal when it\\'s a last resort. \\nwe paid $50. and change including $5 tip for the \"two gnarly pizzas and disgusting chicken wings special\".   \\nincluded in this price was a credit card fee and an after midnight fee. i would never go back!  the service was horrible... sat with empty drinks for half the night, even after asking.  the food was very average and way overpriced.  i honestly would have rather eaten at olive garden, which i compare even their food to microwaved tasting entrees.  the sauce was not good and the shrimp was chewy.  i thought the seating was too close; felt crowded.  don\\'t waste your time and money. this is without a doubt the worst food i have ever tasted, and i will eat anything.\\n1. steak sandwich is in style of a calzone, the bread is bad, steak taste like dog food looks.\\n2. jalepino poppers made me wanna puke after 1 bite. (not kidding)\\n3.gyro came with slices of bad tasting meat.\\n4. fries were cold and soggy on arrival.\\nsomehow hotels let this place slide menus under room door, i now see why they do this.\\nthey are trying to take advantage of tourist not familiar with area. but thanks to yelp, we can help save people time and money one review at a time.\\nthis review doesn\\'t refund my money, but it does give me peace of mind knowing i helped save someone else from ordering from the menu just because it slid under door. don\\'t fall for it, it has 2 stars on yelp for a reason. this used to be one of the - if not the finest restaurant in cleveland.  lord knows what happened, but they can\\'t melt cheese or cook a burger without burning it.\\n\\nstunningly bad.  just amazing.\\n\\nan institution is about to fall.  what a shame. sorry to disappoint you but this was a forgettable experience. i had a craving for some good spaghetti but what i got was a greasy meat sauce on noodles. the seasoning wasn\\'t bad and it was flavorful but you could see the little pools of fat that rendered from the cooked beef. just based on the food on my first (and last) visit, they would have been a 3 or 4 star. the reason for the 1 star was the service. it was a tuesday and the parking lot was nearly full. getting seated, placing the order and getting our salads went well. then the next 30 minutes of waiting for food were accompanied by no update or eye contact until we had to call for someone to ask when the food was going to arrive. not three minutes later we had our spaghetti. we ate in peace as no one asked if the food was ok or offered to refill our drinks. when they came for the plates we requested the check and got out as quickly as possible. it has been years since we have seen service this poor and we never complain. this was just so glaring, i could not hold back this review. last night my family at cicis  pizza.  we hadn\\'t eaten in this restaurant for about a year and boy have they changed.  the restaurant is under staffed.  we went up to the counter quite a few times and there were not any pizza\\'s.  it\\'s hard to believe you go to a pizza buffet and no pizza.  we waited 20 minutes for a desert pizza to be made.  there were a few people working really hard but they needed more people.  the floor had old napkin and it took quite a few minutes for the 1 person to take our used plates away.  we will never go back. i called looking to place an order for delivery and the girl on the phone said they dont deliver to new ken.. before i could even respond saying ill pick it up she hung up on me, how rude. this is about my first and last visit to xyz.  i was not prepared for  the the overcooked plate  of perch for lunch. heavily breaded and cooked to cardboard texture, the perch under the dark brown breading was almost as brown. i never send food back and reorder for fear of retaliation. the fries were the best item on the plate, the slaw ok. the space was cold and needs some tlc. i\\'m not sure i want to try something else as all three of the plates looked the same. perch needs a light crust and being thin fillets, should be cooked to a light brown. how did this place get four stars? first time ordering: the delivery guy couldn\\'t figure out how to ring my very ordinary buzzer, the beverage order was wrong, and though the dish was called eggplant parmesan--it was hard to find any eggplant. just soggy breading. i won\\'t be ordering again from these folks. go to another one. car side sucks. girl was awful. wrong order came out then we sat for 45 min and then she forgot. it was shameful go to macaroni grill. thought i\\'d give them one more chance, tonight still zero hot and ready pizzas and now the customers are stealing sauces when the cashier leaves the counter, which is more often than she\\'s there. doughy pizza with a bad sauce. \\n\\nplus i ordered mozarella sticks and they did not deliver them, charged me for them, and refused a refund. \\n\\ndo not support this business. this place has great pizza but my experience with this location has been awful. they either take over an hour to get you a pizza or they don\\'t deliver it at all. the first time i tried to order a pizza from here they ended up being closed because of a management issue and i never got my pizza (i never got charged) but i also had to wait an hour and a half before realizing it was never coming.\\n\\nthe second time i ordered we had to call about delivery and they had the address written down as camelflower instead of camelback. took about 90 mins. \\n\\nthe third time i tried to order a pizza it took 90 mins before it was delivered and that was only after i called to check in on it. they gave me a free pizza credited to my account as a result. \\n\\nnow, i\\'m sitting here waiting for yet another pizza that was quoted as being delivered in 45 mins.. it has been 90 minutes, again. we called to check in on the pizza (see a trend?) and they said they only had one driver. now, i\\'m wondering if my pizza is going to be cold. \\n\\nbottom line, if you can\\'t figure out how to offer delivery then don\\'t offer it. the food is good but the experience is awful. stop telling people you deliver if you really don\\'t (i could pull off this kind of delivery service as a one man shop). if you\\'re wondering why domino\\'s or pizza hut has been successful it is because they\\'ve mastered the art of pizza delivery. either figure your system out, or give it up. \\n\\nif you\\'re wondering if you should try this place then you should drive to the location and enjoy the food. don\\'t wait for your pizza to be delivered. you might starve. this is not real food. everything is super processed to the point where you can taste it. the chicken fingers tasted like they came from a big frozen bag at sam\\'s club and they were mushy when we got them. the ranch dressing was watery and tasted off brand. the pizza was also nothing to write home about. the best thing was the 2l coke we ordered. my family refused to eat it. huge waste of $50.00. golly, i would tell people not to go here. i simply ask for four pizzas, two with pepperoni, one with olives, and one with pineapple. they gave me only two pizzas, one with pepperoni and olives, the other with pepperoni and pineapple. i can\\'t eat meat. i was with another person, who didn\\'t mind the other topping on his pepperoni. i went back to let them know they made a mistake. i was charged for two more pizzas one with only olives and one with only pineapple. i saw someone tell the cook, how the pizzas should be made. once i got my two pizzas, they had pepperoni with olives and pepperoni with pineapples. again! i was on lunch, there was no point for asking to fix this problem again because i had to go back to work. brought it up to them, ask them if i could just get my money back since i can\\'t eat the pizzas they made me. i was told i could not get my money back only credit. i don\\'t want credit because that was my lunch money to eat. i was told by the employees,\"mistakes happen.\" after i ask for my money back. which i understand mistakes do happen, i work in customers service too. but when i see an employee tell the cook how the pizzas should be made, one with only olives and one with only pineapple, and both pizzas still end up having pepperoni on it. that\\'s not just a mistake. which i still have the receipt that\\'s says cheese pizzas with olives and pineapple. do not eat here!!! i purchased a groupon deal for family meal: large cheese pizza, 20 wings, 2 l soda. worst pizza ever!!we ordered over the phone and picked up the order.it was so greasy, the oil soaked through the box onto my car seat. the flavor is so-so-similar to frozen. the cheese was low quality, the crust was blahh, and the worst part: the sauce was thinly spread.the wings were hard, dry, and tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for hours.the soda was the only thing our family can use. we also ordered manicotti,some beach title pizza, and garlic knots. manicotti was okay. beach pizza was same as cheese pizza with only meager toppings thinly spread out. the garlic knots were hard enough to toss like a rock.we had to order from papa john\\'s.it is so true: if a deal is too good to be true, it usually is.. came here around 3:30 pm on 5/7 and the place was pretty empty so i sat at the bar. asked a couple of food questions w/ the asian bartender and the girl bartender and they both gave me short unwelcoming answers. \\n\\ni had already ordered a coke but decided to leave since i felt like they were both too busy even though i was the only one at the bar. i told the girl bartender i was leaving and if i owe her anything for the coke and she told me $4.82. \\n\\nreally!? i didn\\'t even take a sip out of it. it\\'s not about the money! my intentions were to leave a $2 tip fully expecting her to say \"you don\\'t owe anything.\" \\n\\ni know everyone has bad days and i normally don\\'t write bad reviews but this was ridiculous. i gave her $5 and walked away.\\n\\nhorrible service! go see tony at lemongrass instead! i\\'m a local and you definitely won\\'t catch me here again. no place settings - had to steal from empty table.  dough wasn\\'t cooked all the way, cold and doughy in spots with hot toppings? frozen pizza kinda quality. salads were drenched in dressing to the point of soggy lettuce. bad experienced everrrr!!! never in my life have complained to any businesses but this domino\\'s pizza have the bad service and take forever to have the order ready! took me about  1 hour and 45 minutes (or more) to have my order ready! and gave me attitude!!! what kind of service is thissss????? would never come back here again! ever. \\n\\nit deserve 0 star but no choice! anyhowwww, the foods are fine though. if you ever consider ordering pizza from this place. just call in and come pick up in 2 hours! many people were complaining and cancelled orders!! nothing on the menu looked very good to 3 out of party of 5. so we just all kinda settled on whatever we think we may like most. surprisingly, the cleveland philly was the only thing worth while here and jesus those prices are ghastly. im usually not this kind of guy but sometimes a business deserves to be publicly slammed for a solid pattern incompetence...there isn\\'t a -4 rating??? so i ordered 5 deep dish pizzas, 2 cheese and 3 pepperoni... pretty simple right? hard to really screw that up i would think? \\ni don\\'t know how hard it is to actually take an order and see it through because i\\'ve never worked there but i think it would be easy with computers n stuff, or a pen and paper idk maybe it is a hard job..? \\nanyway i had someone go pick the order up, he didn\\'t know exactly what i ordered but when he came back i ended up with 4 pepperoni pizzas and 1 cheese... \\n\\n****this has been five times in a row they have completely givin me a different order i hope the world sees this and avoids the place, drive down the road a bit further and go to another ceasars, trust me it\\'s worth the gas****\\nso that\\'s that, ya lost a customer obviously ya don\\'t care because the last two times i got the wrong order i brought it to their attention but yet you all still manage to keep a strong track record of screwing up the most important part, the order! i just tried to order a pizza for delivery and got a phone call from the general manager saying that they don\\'t deliver to where i live in deforest.  except they delivered to my house within the last two weeks!  the manager argued with me saying they never have and told me they don\\'t have record of any orders from my phone number, which i updated when i last ordered online and on their delivery map my address is included.  he basically called me a liar to my face, even though the pizza box from their last delivery to my house is still in the garage waiting to go out with the recycling.  if you changed your coverage area fine, but don\\'t be a jerk to a customer and call them a liar.  i have a medical degree and am not some confused idiot.  then i got an email saying that my order was being made.  the manager said that they don\\'t deal with online stuff in their store.  someone needs to get on the same page and be consistent.  worst customer service i\\'ve experienced in years!  i will never order from this franchise nor any other in the area and will be sure to pass along to my friends how they treat customers.  i was so excited to find out they delivered here only to be disappointed.  it\\'s a shame too, because their gluten free pizza was pretty good.  save yourself the grief and go to salvatore\\'s tomato pie\\'s instead.  way better pizza and way nicer people!!! everything at this place is over priced for nothing and the service is okay. do not order a medium mocha if your looking for a regular size, it is tiny. my girlfriend asked for gluten free alternative which they had but, then they came out with her eggs and bacon with 3 sour dough toast on top. it was horrible, no stara would be given if there was one. customer service from the order taker and driver were decent, but this place serves really, really terrible food. i should have known, but i was drawn by what i thought was an awesome coupon deal. you know how you order delivery, and the food smells good? that\\'s not the case here. it reeked of onions.\\n\\nthe pizza was undercooked and bare. i had the supreme which was overloaded with diced raw onions and barely had any other toppings. also, i never thought anyone could screw up buffalo wings. it\\'s just fried wings with buffalo sauce, but they couldn\\'t even do that. the wings looked unsauced and when i asked the driver about it, he was confident that the sauce was there. after a closer inspection i understood, and it was right then and there that i realized their idea of buffalo sauce is lightly dyed grease. besides a very faint smidge of color in the grease, there was no hint of buffalo at all. the wings were really old, as if they were reheated and chilled several times. that was most likely the case. i tossed them away fearing food poisoning in my near future.\\n\\ni am hoping i can stomach the rest of my pizza after reheating it myself. i wish i could get a refund, but i don\\'t want to put up a fight just to hear that they won\\'t provide one. potential customers, please do yourself a favor and stay clear; the only valuable thing you\\'d be ordering here is a life lesson. ordered half a pound of chicken tenders for 6.00 and got 4 tenders. ridiculous. they were cold. the coffee is nothing special and the pizza is like eating dry flavorless cardboard. the older guy behind the bar is an a.h., never smiles and is quit rude. mcdonald\\'s at least gives you a smile and has decent coffee.  i\\'ll go to st clair if i want a good coffee served p[politely. evidently this place is open 24 hours a day. that\\'s great. my roommate can throw up in the toilet 24 hours a day. i\\'m not sure i can tell the difference. \\n\\nbasically take the worst of sbarro\\'s and combine that with the worst of domino\\'s. call it \"new york pizza\" and you\\'ve got gus\\'.\\n\\nstopped in after visiting friends in phoenix, with whom i went to tempe(?). but it\\'s kind of fun to go and say the next day, \"why the hell did we go there last night?\" disappointing. breakfast panini had no flavor and salt really didn\\'t help. can\\'t recommend after ordering two soups and a small cheese pizza and spending 35 dollars my order arrives and i get soup and an everything pizza ? i call and tell them they sent the wrong order they apologize and say they will send the correct order right now do after an hour i call and they say that the phone person that took my order left for the night and forgot to put the order in... then got a little nasty as i was up set them sent another pizza 30 minuteslater... 3 hrs for a pizza and the soup was very salty to the point that i wished i opened a can of soup ... go else were... i guess i didn\\'t learn my lesson tried it today.  this pizza did not hold up to the reviews on here.  bitondo is better and it\\'s close enough to fresca.  this is not new york pizza. if you go there with this expectation you will be disappointed.  pizza nova is better too. we love naked city food because we are from buffalo and this is as close to home as we get here in vegas! but i just called to order takeout and was \"helped\" by the nastiest girl! i\\'m sorry i called and bothered you while you were working, but wow. she literally said, \"ugh let me look at the menu\" when i asked the price of something. the kicker is, then i come in to pickup my food and the only girl working is basically doing nothing. so i didn\\'t even catch her at a busy time. the tavern is closer to our house, but we\\'ll be making the drive to arville from now on. \\n\\nupdate: in addition, they put only one blue cheese in when she specifically asked me if i wanted blue cheese or ranch and i said one of each and she didn\\'t include the side of hot sauce i asked for with our plain fingers. she also left me sitting there with my fresh food for almost 5 solid minutes before cashing me out. \\n\\nmoved my review down from a 3 to a 1 star. never returning. don\\'t waste your time. don\\'t expect to get a pizza around dinner time on a friday. ordered ours today at 6:30 pm was told 45 mins to an hour and it\\'s 10 pm and still not here. called at 7:45 asking where it was and was told its being delivered. called again at 8:15 to find out it was never even sent out but will be the next one delivered. clearly not the case... hopefully i get it before tomorrow. if i could rate them a half star i would we sat at the bar as we usually do and ordered a couple of drinks and some appetizers. our bartender was the worst terrible service and just a bad vibe. we over heard him arguing with a female coworker. it wasn\\'t really busy.. i think he was just having a bad day or is just a jerk. either way he ruined our experience.. went to scarborough location. burnt garlic. fake italian food. loud club music. do not recommend to anyone with a taste bud or self respect. the sunday sauce was not. the pizzas are not. the carbonara was oven bake. wtf. and to insult carbonara even more it was served on penne!  go somewhere else. ordered two pizzas friday night (june 19th). they were delivered quickly, which was great. however, i bit into one of the pieces and pulled out a 4 inch piece of black hair. i proceeded to throw the rest of the pizza away. my husband called to tell them what we had found, indicating we didn\\'t want another pizza delivered (because who would after finding hair?). their response? an apology and then hung up. no offer of a refund or anything. horrible! back to papa john\\'s for our pizza from now on. worst pizza ever.... i was craving some pizza and since my regular pizza joint down the street was closed... i decided to try this one out... big big mistake.\\n\\ntheir bait there is... 2 cheese slices and a small ( kids) drink for $ 5.99\\ni opted for to pay extra for one pepperoni slice and ended up paying 9 bucks....\\n\\nthe pizza was a big soggy doughy mess with almost no cheese or toppings.  it was about  80% dough, 10% sauce, 5% cheese and about 3 slices of pepperoni. i could barley choke it down. ended up throwing most of it away. for having \"pizza\" in their name and that being the selling point of the place... i was very disappointed..  never again\\n\\nthe restaurant was not very attractive ... mirrors were dirty, tables hadn\\'t been cleaned, trash cans were full and dirty, and the counters along the wall were also dirty. nothing like getting a old fruit tart on your first visit!  no one enjoys a freezer burn taste. won\\'t be back. came here around 5:30pm ish before heading to the ed sheeran concert. \\n\\nwe were a party of 2 - my sister and i - and we were seated right away into the basement. \\n\\ndrink orders were taken right away but it took them forever to get bread for the table and then it took some more time- like a really long long long time to get our order in with our server and then even more time to get our food. \\n\\nwe waited and waited while the bread server totally ignored us as he served the table next to us who were seated after us. while other tables didn\\'t have to ask for bread, we had to ask for it. i am not sure why since it was clear that we didn\\'t get any. maybe the servers are blind? maybe racist? maybe sexist? whatever the case was, we waited a very long time for everything. the restaurant wasn\\'t crowded but they should\\'ve expected a saturday night rush especially with an indians game just ending and a concert taking place in the same day. \\n\\nwe finally got our order of burrata, bucatini with rock shrimp in lobster broth, and braised pork cheek in with our server, jimmy.  again, the process of asking our order took forever. maybe the servers are blind? maybe racist? maybe sexist? i don\\'t know what the deal was but it took just as long to get our foods. the table next to us ordered after us and they got their food way before us. \\n\\nwhen we finally got our food, the biggest disappointment was the bucatini with rock shrimp in lobster broth. it was bland. the whole thing was blah. which is odd since it is an italian restaurant. how can you claim that you are an italian restaurant when i\\'m pretty sure the water you cook the pasta in has more flavoring than the lobster broth? and i\\'m korean- i\\'m pretty sure i can make better pasta than the atrocity that the \"italian\" restaurant served us. \\n\\nour braised pork cheek was salty but at this point- about waiting an hour for our food- we were starving and ate the entire dish out of hunger. \\n\\nthe gm finally made way to our table to take the bucatini off our tab but tried to point out that the broth is watery and not a thick sauce. umm we are aware of the difference between broth and sauce but thanks for that. \\n\\neither way, it was bad food, horrendous service and i would never ever come back nor recommend coming to this \"italian\" restaurant. i don\\'t often write reviews but for a bran new place and the place being empty the service was horrible. 5 customers in the bar and yet our server was to busy chatting with bartenders to attend to our drinks. our main food got to our table before the happy hour apps which didn\\'t make sense. all in all i\\'ll stick with timber across the street. pizza 5 stars, customer service zero. the cashier danielle blatantly ignored me when i was the only one  in line for a long time. another customer walked up behind me in line and was waiting also. when danielle finally became available, she took forever for there only being two of us in line, and she starts serving the other guy! hello i was standing here! i told her that i was here first before the other guy and she said,\"well how was i supposed to know\"and when i asked her ,\"why didn\\'t you ask if i needed any help\" her response was,\" why would i\". really!? not sure what the draw is for this place. massive amounts of food, sure, but none of it tasty or satisfying. easily the blandest marinara i\\'ve ever tasted, like chunks of unsalted canned tomatoes, basically. even the calamari was flavorless, as if it was coated in completely unseasoned flour (served with the bland marinara, btw.) we will not be back. decided to try fatbob\\'s pizza during the holiday weekend.  pizza was very greasy, a sign that they are using cheap cheese.  sauce on the pizza was just average, didn\\'t have much flavor to it.  for the high prices that they charge, i expected better quality.  \\n\\noverall, i didn\\'t like the pizza, can\\'t recommend this place. i do not like writing about unpleasant experiences nor do i like giving one star. however...ive had a pretty unpleasant experience here. while staying at the aloft, i ordered lago from the in room menu. by the time i got the food on my table, the cost was already double what i would have paid had i stepped down. furthermore, the delivery guy lied to my face and told me that tip is separate from the already high delivery fees.\\n\\ni ended up going down and speaking to the manager, who did give me the tip back that i paid on top of the room service fee and apologized for the issue. however, this totally ruined my experience and i would have expected the manager to go a little further than just getting me the money that was \"stolen\" from me and either comp the rest of the meal or offer a gift card of some sort to compensate for this horrific experience and the blatant lies of his staff, who deserve to be fired for incidents like this. \\n\\noutside of this specific incident, it would have been nice for them to note the applicable delivery fees on the aloft menu, which are ridiculously high. there wasn\\'t a word about it.\\n\\noh, and pizza was average at best. let me start off saying we called them up to do a delivery of food and beer they took the card number no biggies it would be there in 30 minutes... 1 hour 15 min later no food is here so we call them and ask where the food is they say no it\\'s too far away so why wouldn\\'t you call us back to let us know? $31 charged to the card on top and now waiting for the refund! 1 out of 5 all day long on charging the card then not delivering or informing can\\'t deliver food to are location. came here for breakfast with my boyfriend. not impressed from the start but my boyfriend loves biscuits and gravy so we decided to stay. we were seated and given drinks rather quickly. then we waited for the waitress to come back and take our order for a while. then we received our food and it wasn\\'t as good as i was expecting. i got the eggs benedict with country potatoes. it all had a pasty taste and was really just not good. then it took forever for the waitress to come back to ask how everything was and just to check on us. then took forever to get the bill for us to even be able to pay. that will probably be the only money they get from us. we should have made the drive to scottsdale to go to butters! olive garden continues its slow down hill slide. this particular location had a leaky awning out side draining water onto the benches out side. the staffs answer to this was to throw napkins on the wet bench. wait staff was unfriendly and inattentive. salad literally tasted like it had a cigarette butt in it. bread sticks were cool and extra salty. waited over 45 minutes for entrees to be served. waitress dumped my wife\\'s leftovers and mine together in one box, despite both meals being vastly different and not compatible. terrible service, worse food. go anywhere but here... it\\'s gross.  don\\'t waste your money please!  hope this helps you! used to eat here many years ago when studying at nevada school of massage therapy. went in today at 10.30 (they close at 11), their floors were being cleaned and they asked us to stay on one side, we were the only people in there except for one lady with a take out order. \\nwe ordered two slices with a limited english speaking person and were told $4 by some other guy. no hello, no, are you eating in, no anything else... we added and drink and asked for ranch too late as they had already swiped our card. they asked us to include .60 cents on the tip line when signing. \\nvery rude, gives no shits attitudes. they heated our slices ($5.00 total btw) and packed in a too go \\'box\\'. we pulled them out and ate at a table. they turned off wheel of fortune on the tv and just kind on stared at us until we finished and left by 10.45. \\nrude. \\nthey only get 1 stars because of the memories. pizzas not fabulous. service is horrible. good: i walked in and was greeted by the entire assembly line.\\n\\nbad: everything else. once they did their company policy greeting, they were real punks. i\\'ll give the young guy an exception. he kept quiet and had to deal with his coworkers longer than i had to. when we ordered, we had a coupon, then asked if we could stack another coupon. they replied with \"no. because you\\'re already getting like $4 off anyways.\" ok? be more more of a smart butt next time, please. then we ordered the pizza. we ordered a 5-meat stuffed pizza and i requested that they don\\'t put cheddar on it, and instead use mozzarella. they were annoyed, then they took a pre made pizza, and literally scraped off the toppings with their hands right in front of us. ....yummy.\\n\\n\\nsome additional comments:\\n\\n* you\\'re a pizza place. pizza is italian. it\\'s literally an italian sin to put cheddar cheese on a pizza. stop with the cheddar cheese, non italian \"pizza\" makers. \\n\\n*and yes, i know how to turn the oven on. thanks for asking and insulting my intelligence. i guess being from chicago i am a pizza snob. i wanted this pace to be good because it 2 mins from my house however, nothing but bad cheap.pizza. when the sausage tastes like mystery meat yu know there is a problem. nothing home made here, all out of the freezer or a box. someone stated they had the best cheese sticks ever, really? the best frozen deep fried cheese sticks? much better options. if you listen to 680 news i\\'m sure you\\'ve heard their ads on the radio talking about 50 flavours of wings and amazing pizza ... this is what brought me in.\\n\\nplaced a pick up order online and when i arrived to pick up was asked what i ordered even though they had a print out of the order. i repeated my order and was told they didn\\'t have the wing flavour ordered that they only had hot and honey garlic. for somewhere that claims 50 flavours i found it disappointing that only 2 were available and wasn\\'t called before i showed up to let me know this wasn\\'t available. another item ordered they didn\\'t have and i had to wait for my pizza to be made.\\n\\nthe whole experience was bad and when i got home and opened everything up realized they forgot one thing i ordered. i emailed and called (no one answered) the customer service line and have not heard back yet.\\n\\ni would not recommend this place to anyone and definitely will not be ordering from here again. epic fail!\\n\\ni asked four times to change the pasta sauce from tomato to alfredo, and four times the woman said \\'yes yes we can do that\"  then my order arrived and they had changed the pasta from spaghetti to fettuccine, but it was still covered in tomato sauce.\\n\\nwhen i called back she claimed that she had clarified before ending the call, and i reminded her that i did clarify before the call... after 5 minutes of her making excuses to defend her incompetence, she flat out told me that they were too busy to offer me a substitute, and offered no credit on my next order either.\\n\\nthe salad was mostly a container full of lettuce and a pittance of topping... low quality ingredients.\\n\\ni ordered a cheeseburger, which on the menu it states:  bacon and cheeze.  it came with no bacon, covered in onions, tomato and lettuce.\\n\\ni paid almost $50 for my food, and ate half a burger, the chicken parm, and threw the rest out.\\n\\ni should have known better... this place has sucked for years. ordered a thin crust pizza from here last night.  was hands down, one of the worst pizzas i have ever had.  it tasted like cardboard.  was delivered before expected delivery time, but wasn\\'t even close to warm.  did i mention it tasted like cardboard?  very disappointing. was the worst tasting pizza ever! very bland.....the ranch was so runny i was  wondering either they let it sit out or added water to cut the cost. the place smelled like sewer and there were bugs everywhere! food was good. pathetic service. they ran out of serving bowls and served in takeaway boxes. moreover, they didn\\'t even care to clean the tables covered in used bowls even after requesting them multiple times. this was my first visit to the city and had a really bad experience at this place. i wouldn\\'t give this place one star if i had a choice too they are the most rude people i\\'ve ever delt with there pizzas are gross. they are very soggy dough is never fresh. i went a couple of times a week and the cook is always outside smoking cigarettes and when he goes back in doesn\\'t even bother washing his hands before he makes my pizza. i will never eat there again in my life couple days later i had the stomach flu from eating there food i suggest you do not eat there at all. i really liked the food here at first. i also love that they deliver, serve espresso drinks, and have a relatively friendly staff. actually a great staff, with wonderful customer service and the genuine attitude of a local business that cares about their customers. however it is hit or miss, because they seem to have a girl answering phones and taking orders who is a complete idiot. not only is she an idiot, but she lacks any sense of customer service, and has a very bitchy \"what do you want\" kind of attitude with people. to call her mentally challenged would be an insult to the mentally challenged, seeing as i have dined there twice and seem to know a great deal more about the restaurant and the services they provide than this bimbo. i took two stars off just for her and if she is working or answering the phone when i come in, i will take my business elsewhere.\\n\\n***edit: after i received a friendly message from the owner apologizing and offering a free meal, (which i have yet to accept and probably never will) i returned because i liked the food so much and wanted to share the fun environment with a guest. both of the girls working treated me heinously from the instant we approached the counter. perhaps they had seen this review and recognized me, or perhaps they just have impossibly terrible manners and attitudes. either way, they do not seem like friendly people who understand that customers are supposedly to be treated with respect. although the owner seems to be a wonderfully dedicated and kind person, i cannot give anything higher than 1-star after the way i have been treated. i am not a very resilient person; i am emotionally sensitive. my feelings were hurt to be treated that way especially after the several crappy experiences that i had prior. to be perfectly clear, even though i did not feel good about the way i was treated i never went out of my way to make those girls feel bad about how poorly they were behaving while they were being paid to do so, and i truly feel that their actions are entirely unjustified. ideally, they would also be held responsible, as unlikely as this is. also, please note that most of the negative reviews about the staff have been flagged, meaning someone who works there is fully aware of the problem and refuses to do a single thing about it. just wow. we\\'ve been a few times for lunch, and while its convent and has good food the service leaves something to desire. \\n\\ntoday, we walked in and stood waiting for direction to a table. after a couple minutes of no acknowledgement we picked a table. we waited another two minutes and after no acknowledgement again we talked about moving to the bar. \\n\\nthere were other tables who were being served. as we moved to the bat, another party arrived, was acknowledged and sat with menus. \\n\\nafter this, we decided to leave. the lunch service leaves a lot to be desired. this was the last time we will try again for lunch. can not justify a frozen crust gluten pizza the size of a plate for $16.90 ridiculous! it scary to eat here. \\nto top it all off, pizza was burnt. beyond chard. \\ni don\\'t mind paying higher prices but quality has to meet price. \\nridiculous! took over 2 hours to deliver. called after and hour and a half and was told it was on its way, it would be hot and fresh. nope! it\\'s cold! just awful. don\\'t order from here, at least not for delivery, maybe pick up is better. maybe... waited an hour for the food to come. when it arrived it looked like it was sitting in the drivers trunk for two days. medium pizza and couldn\\'t stomach a single slice. my girlfriend and i are now out $30 and still hungry. check your pizza before you pay.. really. the staff at the restaurant was very rude and i will never return again. the food is nothing to right home about and service sucks. i also felt as if i was being discriminated against because of my race. their tag line, \" better ingredients, better pizza, papa john\\'s\", should be changed to \" better pizza, horrible service where the manager hangs up on you, papa john\\'s\"! i was sent an email with a special discount. i followed the link and ordered a pizza for delivery. like i\\'ve done a dozen times before. i\\'m sure they drivers remember me, i tip well. the promised time of 19-29 minutes seemed great. ordered at 7:23pm. at 8:20 pm i called to ask about my food. i was placed on hold immediately. 4-5 minutes. the girl finally picked up and i asked about my dinner, gave my name and address.. she seemed confused. she said the address they had for my order was next door to them and they cancelled it. i asked \"why didn\\'t you call me? you have my number.\" she couldn\\'t answer, but said she would get a manager. the manager, no name offered, came to the phone after a solid 4 minutes. (this call is now 10 minutes long). in a nut shell he said they thought it was a prank call and cancelled it.  i gave him my address, name and even offered my customer number from the web order. he didn\\'t care. he was equally silent when i asked why didn\\'t he call me to confirm the address? he responded with blaming me for the mix up and hanging up on me! no apologies,no offer to correct the error. he just hung up. this is not the first time i\\'ve had issues with this store. it will be the last. there are 3 other pizza places in the immediate area, they now get my business and money. good bye papa. they have a big sign in front of the location near the tempe commuter center advertising their great breakfast.   they took my interest with that so i gave it a try.   i had the impression that i was the first person to ever come in for breakfast!   the bartender didn\\'t know about breakfast and asked me to talk to the gentleman at the coffee bar.   he fumbled around for a while looking for the breakfast menu, and first showed me a lunch menu which was a sloppy hand-written page covered in grease and grime.   then he finally found the breakfast menu, also a nasty little printed sheet with a lot of kitchen grime on it.   i looked at the \"menu\" for as long as i could stand it, and ordered a skillet with coffee.   the coffee arrived fairly quickly, and tasted like maxwell house.   the skillet arrived eventually, and by itself would be a two star item.   the dining room is comfortable enough with really neat tables chairs and booths, but the atmosphere is ruined by the music which is a free pandora stream playing good music punctuated by annoying, blaring commercials.   hey, restaurant owner: you can\\'t afford to subscribe to a streaming radio station?   this restaurant is in a location that enjoys foot traffic from downtown business and municipal employees, university students, and tourists.   it looks like a good concept and should be executed much better.   revo pizzabar is not seizing the opportunity and is not quite delivering what their signs promise.   overall, two stars for the food, zero for the coffee, and one star for the review.   my recommendation is to pass, and the search continues for a downtown tempe breakfast stop. came in because of ddd. i ordered the butternut squash ravioli.\\nwas so looking forward to it, sounded yummy. much to my dismay, there were seven raviolis. that\\'s all. yes, they were tasty, but seven???? i asked the person behind the counter, if this was the ones listed on the board. she said no, and showed me a menu. i found them. i was shocked. $17.00, for seven raviolis.\\nyes, $17.00 for seven raviolis=$2.42 each. no soup. no salad. went somewhere else to get more food.\\nnever is soon enough to go back this place serves disgusting food at a high price.  there is also a creepy, male-dominated atmosphere that i find offensive.  the waitresses seem cowed.  \\n\\ntheir \"meat\" sauce and \"meat\" balls contain pork, but the menu doesn\\'t mention that.  if you get chicken with your pasta, it will be served as a whole breast that is cut into thick strips and placed on top of the pasta.  the chicken looks and tastes nasty and old.  i almost thought i was eating a chicken tumor, rather than an actual breast.  i imagine the upper crust head chef picking out the tumor at the market, throwing it in his backpack, and then riding to work on his bicycle before preparing it for me.\\n\\ni asked for some basil to lighten up the very heavy flavor of the tomato-cream linguini.  they gave me some and charged me a buck.  when i am paying $25 for some noodles, cheap sauce, and a tumor, i think they should give me the basil for free.  the fact that i asked for the basil indicates that the food isn\\'t very good, and they should care about that.\\n\\nsorry, upper crust, but i will be stepping out and paying you no heed in the future. we selected this restaurant because of its location in the mirage.  bad choice.  the service was great but the food was pretty terrible.  cesar salad was drenched in dressing - remember people: it\\'s a dressing, not an overcoat.  the croutons were unexciting pieces of fried bread.  my husbands caprese had loads of cheese but hardly any tomato and my linguine with clam sauce was miserably prepared - thick, almost pasty sauce. \\n\\nwith all the amazing food available in vegas, this restaurant was a big disappointment. wanna hear a riddle? ever notice how every one who eats at guys is drunk? \\n\\nyou give? because had they been sober they would notice the blend taste of cardboard overwhelming their delectable palates. it s passable at best. but recently they\\'ve outdone themselves. i somehow managed to get ill eating that stuff. i ve never gotten food poisoning from pizza before. this was a first. this is not hyperbole, march 2nd i had the absolute worst theater experience in my 30 years of living. \\n\\nfirst let me say that movies are my passion, i get involved and when momentum of films are completely destroyed, it destroys the movie experience for me. \\n\\ni was catching the 7pm showing of logan, which tied with episode viii is my most anticipated movie of the year. there were unruly guests sitting in the seats to the right of my viewing party and i will go into more detail later, but since that isn\\'t something fatcats can completely control, it\\'s not the focus of this message. \\n\\nduring the climax and resolution, towards the ending of the movie, where all the drama is wrapping up, the emotional core of the film, the house lights come on. this was incredibly distracting and led to the entire theater chattering and wonder what was going on. as the movie continued for a couple minutes in a fully lit auditorium the house lights then turned off and the movie rewound about 10 minutes. this utterly destroyed the momentum of the narrative and in doing so the entire theater felt it appropriate to just freely talk. so now, not only was the momentum destroyed but the audience\\'s attention is all but lost. as we reach the fateful moment, the house lights came on again in the same spot, much to the chagrin of audience. this caused the audience to chatter even louder, so even though i am seeing a bulk of this scene for a second time i am still not getting the entirety of it thanks to the plethora of distractions. this time the movie continued with house lights on, which as it turns out only had 30 seconds remaining anyway, \\n\\nwhat was worse was the way the manager treated guests as we approached the desk. we were given 10 dollar gift cards to the arcade. which is weird because i didn\\'t have a bad arcade experience. i had no idea why we weren\\'t given movie passes to see the movie at a later date, this time without the technical problems. now it was a nice gesture and that didn\\'t go unnoticed by me, however a handful of other patrons felt the way i did. we don\\'t frequent the arcade or bowling alley, which i am sure are a hoot, but i was there to see and enjoy a movie, which was obstructed due to technical difficulties. so when the manager reaches the table and i kindly explained that i would prefer either a refund or compensation for the movie, after rolling his eyes and puffing he throws another gift card on the counter with attitude instead of to my extended hand saying \"this is $20, is that good enough?\".  \\n\\nno, it wasn\\'t and it\\'s not because i wanted more money, i wanted to be treated with understanding and respect considering that a movie i paid to see was ruined because of technical difficulty. i\\'m not an unreasonable guy, i know that technical difficulties happen but this certainly wasn\\'t what i paid money for. what did i do to deserve a bad attitude? because i was in a situation with many other people where it would be impossible to have been satisfied? imagine if i bought a bluray and the last part of the movie was scratched or kept skipping, is it unreasonable to ask for a replacement? no and certainly wouldn\\'t expect a condescending attitude. \\n\\ni can\\'t recommend this facility. i understand this could be an isolated incident and perhaps it happens one in thousand screenings, which would be outstanding odds. the problem is the staff didn\\'t care to prove that these things rarely happen. the staff didn\\'t seem to care to have me come back and make up for the poor visit. i didn\\'t want or expect anything more than just the movie refunded or replaced and when that was explained, i was treated like i was the jerk. not only was this the worst movie going experience i have had but possibly one of the poorest customer service experiences i have had. the \"manager\" seemed put out at the notion of relating to customers, much less indicate any ounce of empathy to the situation. instead i was treated like i did something wrong. \\n\\ni think the only thing i did wrong was chose to see a movie at fatcats\\n\\ni am writing this because i want fatcats to improve. i want them to be able to provide excellent experiences and treat customers great. there are a lot of children that frequent this location because they do have an arcade and bowling and i am sure when movies like moana or zootopia come out they get to make a day of it and the idea that a family or kids could even possibly receive the same treatment that we did after having such a horrible movie experience is upsetting to me. \\n\\n- phill stricklin\\n\\np.s.\\n\\nnow, something that fatcats aren\\'t entirely responsible for are disruptive movie goers. we were stuck next to three members who persisted to talk at regular talking volume throughout the entirety of the movie, when asked to stop they would momentarily but minutes later would continue. one gentleman had his cell phone illuminated practically the entire showtime on his knee, lighting up the entire row behind him and distracting the p only had 1 person inside waiting on ppl and at the bar. was there for 20 mins and no one came to take my order, when all i wanted was a slice of pizza to go (that was already made). \\n\\nterrible service. terrible pizza extremely disappointing especially from a james beard chef. the forager was so greasy and under seasoned. wonderful ingredients however poor execution, not impressed at all. will stick to settebello at least the pizza is seasoned and good!! the bread sticks are a palate killer and ruin your taste buds loaded with grease and spice. little over priced in my opinion after 2 glasses of wine, beet salad, cheese and charcuterie $100 plus tip, the food and the service were both bland. step it up we expect more out of a james beard chef, especially because sage is incredible. i want to like this place because the mesa location is very close to us. but having tried it a few times, the service has been less than desirable. we don\\'t care for new mexico style food (lots of peppers and onions etc.) which is what most of this menu seems to be. i keep reading about the prickly pear chicken sandwich here on yelp. it looks like i will need to give it a try. being from az, prickly pear anything is typically very good. very poor service, very poor cocktails and they don\\'t care. would give 0 star. clerk did not return the correct change ($5) and said i was \"gipping\" her after i was still holding out my hand in front of her with the money she just gave. needles to say, she did not return my money. pizza was extremely cold after picking it up on time. terrible experience. we were seated at a table that was way too small for our family (it was not busy, lots of other places they could have put us). my husband had to step out with one of our children and wasn\\'t able to come back to finish, so i asked if they could put his meal to go, so he could eat. they did but didn\\'t give him any plastic silverware to go, knowing he didn\\'t get to eat. worthless. they also charged us for \"table games\", which we did not play (new electronics on the table so you can swipe your card to pay there.) when i pointed it out, they did not offer to remove it because we had paid before i noticed the extra $1.99 charge. why do people go to olive garden?  why did i go here today?\\nsimple answer: with force.  \\ni had to go where a member of the family chose to go.  i haven\\'t eaten here in about 8 years.  many reasons which were confirmed tonight.\\npasta was mushy. the \"famous\" salad actually had decent flavor but was drenched in dressing.  breadsticks were a bit hard and tasted like buttered white bread.  fish was breaded but okay tasting.  pizza was not so good. didn\\'t like the cheese.  to sum up the whole meal: it was like heating up a \"t.v. dinner.\" ordered the calamari and a buffalo chicken pizza with no onions and paid an extra fee for a side of ranch. the calamari was so over cooked that i couldn\\'t chew through it and the pizza had a lot of onions... and they forgot our ranch. not worth the $44. and don\\'t say you have coke products if you carry pepsi ... thought we would try the place out since we never had been there.  the service was great at the drink order time, then went down hill from there.  started out with a house salad and blue cheese dressing, they brought out ranch.  drinks took forever to be refilled.  food came out all but the cal zone, they said it takes a little longer,  never came out.  they said, after flagging them down again, they forgot to turn that order in.  really?  they offered a dessert, we just wanted the cal zone.  they offered dessert again, said no just box up the cal zone, we\\'re going.  paid and left. i do not recommend ever ordering delivery from this location. i decided to give them another chance because the first time i ordered it was football sunday, took over 2 hours to receive my pizza and it was delivered cold. this time, i was estimated a 28-38 min delivery time. i placed my order at 6:07. it was taken out of the oven at 6:25. i didn\\'t receive my order until 7:25. i called the location right before it arrived and they assured me it would be warm because they keep it under a heating lamp. i have worked in a pizza place. a pizza does not hold up for half a hour under a heating lamp and half a hour in a bag out for delivery. the manager, sandra, is equally as rude and refused to do anything about the experience. i have complained to corporate and they can\\'t do anything because this is a privately owned business. if you want pizza, you are better off going across the street and getting one from little caesars. disappointing first experience. service was slow on a sunday morning at 11:00 when it was not even busy. finally a server arrived to take our order. 10-15 minutes later they come back and say they are out of the meatloaf my husband ordered. we had ordered a couple of beer flights that never even showed up. since he had his heart set on the meatloaf, my husband was not finding anything else that sounded good, so rather than trying to figure out something else to settle for, we decided to leave. they really need to get their act together. the other menu items seemed intriguing, but if the service is lacking, they will not survive. ordered for carry out and we were overcharged.  we were told we needed a coupon.  don\\'t trust their invoices. go elsewhere.  the pizza will be better too. i ate here two times: my first time and my last time.\\n\\nwalking in and seeing only three other tables occupied, and not being greeted or seated promptly is not really a good start. \\n\\nit\\'s also annoying to wait nearly 10 minutes for your server to greet you and bring you menus.\\n\\na taco salad does not consist of greasy shredded steak that you\\'d find in a philly cheesesteak, mixed salad greens, sweet dressing in a greasy taco shell.\\n\\nwhen said \"taco salad\" was pointed out as not being a taco salad, having a waitress try to tell me i didn\\'t read the menu right and that\\'s how it comes was laughable seeing as though the menu described it as having: ground beef, pico de gallo, sour cream, black beans and guacamole.\\n\\nthe only saving grace was that i only paid $4.99 for that joke of a taco salad (happy hour). yes, i still ended up paying for it...\\n\\nit may be rhodes ranch, but even taco bell can make a better taco salad.\\n\\nthanks but no thanks! undercooked. terrible dough. basically no toppings. wings are inedible. how is this place still in business...barf. we stopped off for a late breakfast after a night on the town. we had to wait a long time to be seated as many servers walked past and failed to acknowledge us. we were seated by a nice server and then waited about ten minutes until a less than cheerful server took our order. this was of course after several tables seated after us were served.  then after another 25 minutes we were told that our order was delayed because of they were switching from breakfast to lunch. what?!?!?!  we left at that point having wasted a half an hour trying to get some eggs and toast. worst service from start to finish i\\'ve had in maybe forever.  the food we did see appeared to be standard diner fair with a slight up charge. i would have to say don\\'t waste the time or money. wish they had a no star rating. pizza hut is no longer in business at this location, it has been gone for many years. it closed last year, as was no loss, imho. a neighborhood favorite for some unfathomable reason, but stopped by several times and it was always the worst italian food i and my dining companions had ever had--couldn\\'t even make a good marinara sauce:-( this used to be our place to stop for lunch when we shopped in the area and i must\\'ve been there a dozen times. generally eating cheap italian food like this makes you feel kind of shitty in the end but that\\'s something we always factored in as it\\'s expected so that\\'s fine - the food is reasonably tasty for the price.\\n\\nrecently we ate there and suddenly my wife literally had to run to the bathroom to throw up. the food didn\\'t taste off or anything and we thought maybe she ate too fast or maybe the food was too heavy as she ate very little in the morning. \\n\\nas we were leaving i went to the men\\'s washroom and one of the sinks was full of vomit. i notified the management about this - when there are around 10 people in the restaurant and two cases of throwing up at the same time it\\'s not an accident anymore. the management basically told us that it can\\'t be their food, everything\\'s done fresh etc. and added \"but thanks for telling us\". \\n\\nit was clear at this point that no responsibility is taken - or even admission that it could potentially be their food that\\'s causing the problem. of course it\\'s possible that two customers out of 10 happen to throw up for some other reason within 30 minutes - but the chances are pretty close to zero.\\n\\ni walked out and will not be back. i simply can\\'t reward an establishment that flat out denies the possibility of their food being defective and offers no compensation (or even a partial refund..!) for a ruined day and the humiliation of throwing up in the public. i see now why past comments have multiple references to poor service and customer care. chicken was under done. had to repeat myself i dont know how many times thru the drive thru. shut it down. rude service. heard they still supplies and sell them in the hood. selling hot wings in plastic bags and stealing. i stopped going. no ethics. just hoodrat location. un-expectantly the worst filet mignon i have ever had. outside of the steak was burnt, dry and tasteless but inside is medium well. $30 for the black steak cardboard.\\n\\nand the server didn\\'t even bother to ask how was our meals, refill drinks or refill bread?! but rest assured they automatically add 18% gratuity even though i think they didn\\'t deserved it. check totaled $97 for four adults. \\n\\nridiculous! never here again, even if it\\'s free. way too loud! sound dampening needed asap! so crowded we couldn\\'t get a table for hours, couldn\\'t get served, couldn\\'t hear to order. will not go back. if i could give negative stars,  i would!! this was the worst pizza and wings i\\'ve ever had! the pizza dough was still raw and the wings burnt bones... so disappointing! i have visited this pizza hut a few times but my last experience pushed me over the edge. i stopped in for lunch-they offer a buffet. $5.99 for all you can eat pasta, pizza, and breadsticks along with one side salad. it\\'s actually a good deal if, and that\\'s a big if, there is pizza available. \\nas mentioned before i have been to this location multiple times for lunch and each time has gotten worse. it is not uncommon for all pizza, pasta, and breadsticks to be gone on the buffet. the employees should know there is going to rush at lunch time and plan accordingly. not sure if they need to prepare more pizza in advance and keep it warm or have more staff to make pizza for the buffet and other orders but improvements are needed. \\nmoving onto the staff, these employees are some of the worst i have ever seen. drinks are not refilled, plates are not cleared, and checks are not brought. i had to walk to the counter to request more water as well as request my bill. it is not uncommon for tables to remain dirty/piled with plates until there is no other seating available and the staff is forced to clean. \\nlong and short this pizza hut has a lot to improve on. i would highly recommend avoiding them during lunch. we took my whole family here for mother\\'s day brunch and it was actually awful. we had a party of 11 people. we made the reservations ahead of time and the day before they called to say there was a race in front of the restaurant and we couldn\\'t park out front. my 80-year old grandma was coming with us and she has trouble walking. the restaurant apologized but had no options for handicapped parking with the race going on. my dad parked in town and wheeled her in a wheelchair across the bridge. this worked out fine, but when we arrived at the restaurant they had us at a table upstairs. we asked them to show us to the elevator. they didn\\'t have one. so after all the discussion the day before about handicapped parking why on earth would they seat us upstairs? we had to wait for a table to be set up downstairs. luckily they were not busy.  we were seated near an outside door and had space for the wheelchair but by the time we were ready to leave they added a table outside in front of the door so we had quite a bit of trouble maneuvering the wheelchair to get out! \\n\\nwe also had trouble with the food. my mom and sister don\\'t eat gluten so they ordered a meal that had potatoes listed as the side dish. it came out of the kitchen with noodles instead of the potatoes. they said they changed the menu. but that should be explained by the waitstaff when someone orders the meal! we also waited over 15 minutes before someone even took our order. \\n\\ni did enjoy my own meal but all of the other trouble was not worth it. we won\\'t be back to this location and especially not on a holiday when we expected to go all out for our mothers and treat them to an expensive meal without any issues about seating and such! way over priced and the on-line prices are nowhere near the prices they charge when you show up.  i explained this to the manager when i felt i was being overcharged and she simply tossed a to go menu at me and stated here are our prices.  i was charged nearly $12 dollars for a chicken pita and pasta salad.  the chicken was over cooked, dry and extremely salty.  the pasta salad was good.  won\\'t be back as there are much better quality at better values in downtown. try harding at it\\'s best. 17th ave (and calgary on the whole) is being flooded with \"monkey see monkey do\" restaurants. this one is not an exception. great location, great space...except for the fact that there is always a lineup for the washroom. \\n\\nstaff there (this summer - july) did not know the menu, and two of the pizza\\'s we ordered were exactly the same less 1 ingredient. i think that\\'s a little weak for a new menu.....\\n\\nanyway. they tried to fix the situation, which was nice. \\n\\nfor eating in a parking lot surrounded by boards off of 17th ave..ambience outside get\\'s a 3/10..the rest.....just not original or well executed. \\n\\ndisappointed because it looked to have potential. nellos ahwatukee,\\nstopped in after a hard day, and got a pizza to go.\\none of the most tasteless pizzas i have eaten, (ate only one slice).\\nasked my wife how hers was, she said eh.\\nhave eaten here before. as i recall, it was much better. \\ni could\\'ve gotten more flovor from dominos, or pizza hut, although the flavors not good, at least, you got flavor.\\nnoticed alot of people got various toppings, i didn\\'t.\\ni think if you get a good pizza,it should taste good plain, to start with, then add toppings. if it dosen\\'t, the pizza\\'s goin to be mediocre at best.\\ntry florencias on ray rd. much much better, regardless of toppings. while the pizza is decent, the service is not so good. being told it would be 45 minutes for a pick up order is fine. however, after showing up at about 40 minutes and paying then being told it would still be a few minutes and nothing even 15 minutes later, patience is over. then after asking how much longer and come to find out our pizza has been sitting on top of the oven since walking in, is just not right!! then after pointing out that we have been waiting an extra 15 minutes for no reason, there was no apology, just \" sorry i didn\\'t see it\". totally unexceptable! will never go back. there are plenty of other choices in the area. not worth my time as clearly they could care less about my time and their mistake!! i was in town for the weekend and decided to have a quick dinner with my family. i love pizza hut, like love, love them. this one was terrible. the sauce tasted funny and the crust was kind of chewy. this did not even compare to the bad service.\\n\\ni made an online order and did not receive a call to confirm my order so i called them. they confirmed my order. my husband went to go pick it up. when i got up to get mine i noticed that both pizzas were the same. i called the store and spoke to a manager, she was kind of condesending and made me feel like i was lying. i asked to have the replacement delivered since it was just down the street. she wanted to give me credit and i said no because i don\\'t even live there. she told me it would take 40 mins for it to be delivered and that she would call when it was on it\\'s way. \\n\\nby then it was already getting late and i was starting to fall asleep. 45 mins passed and there was no call. i was about to call back when i finally got a knock on the door. the driver told me i had a balance due and i said, \"nooooo...\" he said oh, you paid online? i said yes. so he said there wasn\\'t a signature line and he had to get my signature. then he said, that\\'s funny, there\\'s no delivery charge. i said i hope not. he then asked me if they messed up on my previous order and i said yes, i got the wrong pizza. then he really pissed me off because he\\'s still holding the pizza and annoyingly says, \"well i wish they would\\'ve told me this was a freebie!\" why would they tell you that? does it matter? do you do something special to it like spit on it before it gets there because it\\'s free? \\n\\nso rude from beginning to end. dominos had a deal for $6 medium pizza, which i thought was a good deal and you get two toppings. went to pick it up and they should have just said $6 small pizza, the box was a small. it serve probably 3 people if they all had 3 pizza each. when i went to pick it up the guy was on his cellphone, but don\\'t worry he was nice enough to put his phone down when i came in. not worth the savings. neon lights and open signs should mean that they are willing to serve! not at this establishment!! please tell me or note things that cannot be done prior to a time. i\\'m merely wanting food, there is no need to be explicit with your language. thank you i will never come here again the service was mediocre at best, and unfriendly. the pizza is far from famous. i ordered a slice of pepperoni to go and my order was placed on a paper plates and the placed in a paper bag with no other covering. by the time i drove 2 mikes back to my destination it was cold and tasted as if it were previously frozen.. will not be returning here... fyi: their pizza \"patio\" is not dog or even kid friendly. after we sat down outside and the waitress took our drink orders, she came back out to tell us that the dogs were only allowed to be tied up on the outside of the patio. she also added that kids weren\\'t allowed on the patio either. there were no signs saying any of these rules posted inside or outside at the patio. if you\\'re looking for a nice outdoor patio to bring your kids or furry friend and enjoy a nice drink or meal...this isn\\'t the place. one star is being kind.  i moved here in mid 2014.  shortly after i broke a tendon in my knee.  so, driving was out of the question.  i then discovered tailgaters.  i ordered a batch of wings for delivery.  the wings were out of sight.  they were large and saucy,and even with an option for \\'drumettes\\' only.  i loved them so much, the next week i tried again.  they gave me a 45 minute delivery time.  1:30 later the delivery shows.  food was ice cold.  even the grease/oil on wings solidified.  weeks later, craving wings, i tried again.  keep in mind, i live less than a mile from this location.  we waited one hour (15 mins after promised time) and called in.  they said food was just sent out.  30 mins later still no food.  after a 1:45 minute wait, the delivery person shows and by that time food was cold and i turned order away.  i did try and order weeks later and for the last time.  they called several  minutes after order and were out of my  fettuccine and tried to substitute.  again they were late.  when i called, they claimed we never answered our door.  our dining room (where i sat and wait) is inches from door.  when delivery arrived, he mentioned nothing to the fact of/when he was previously here but did say how short staffed they were. my friends took me to l\\'academie last night for my birthday ! we all love l\\'academie the food is always delicious and the ambiance very pleasant plus its byow! everything was fine until the so called manager of the place interacted with us in the rudest and most inappropriate way! we did mention to him that we had not appreciate the way he had talked to us but he did not even hint a pinch of remorse. quite frankly  a fake apology would have done it for me but i guess he judged that we were not even worth that. so clearly i don\\'t recommend this place. i will stick to the one on crescent!!!! this once great pizza has gone downhill to a point where they might as well close this last one up.  i am writing this while my insides are  in great distress after eating one of their pizzas.  never again will i be so stupid to eat from there again. chicken shit mothafukas cant do anything right , by far the worst place i\\'ve been to never again. all of the staff are a bunch of morons that includes the manager !! i have eaten here before and they were okay. i recently called for a delivery and they were very rude on the phone. they could\\'ve just nicely said that they don\\'t deliver by me i\\'m literally an exit away from them - 5 miles away from me that is too long? i will not be visiting them again! ordered food for delivery, was told it would take 45-55 minutes, no problem. called after an hour to ask about my order, and was told the driver was late but the food was ready, and it would be at my door in five minutes, a little irritating, but no big deal. 20 minutes pass and still no pizza. i called again, this time to cancel the order because i\\'m not waiting  for an hour and a half to get cold food. fuck that. then the owner shows up *in under 5 minutes* and starts spewing shit about a discount. never ordering here again. glad my dog was with me so he wouldn\\'t come close to the door. there is a minumun order per head rule here which is not listed anywhere in the store. rip off never come back again. i had not eaten in about 12 hours since we were at the hospital having a baby... and this pizza still tasted horrible.\\n\\nbarely average fast food quality and taste. avoid! i had a 14\\' pepperoni pizza and the best way i could described what the pizza tasted like was little caesars pizza. wasn\\'t pleasant... the slice of pizza was good. the service by general manager vincent was horrible! the location is inside the linq, potential for better business. but the restaurant was empty and quiet. vincent was rude and unprofessional. no wonder why they did not have any clients dining in and even the staff looked unhappy. i wanted to dine in but unfortunately we were denied service for a party of four because i had my smoothie drink that had piña colada but because it was an outside drink we were not allowed? hello - we are in vegas, everyone is walking around with a drink. besides the point, the outcome would have been a positive one if vincent wasn\\'t rude! i asked if he was the owner and he said he was it, wow he should go to business school to first obtain an education on service and then know how to run a successful business. i ducked in for a quick takeaway lunch on a rainy monday this week. i was the only customer in the store the entire time my meal was prepared. after ordering and paying for the \"beta kabob sub,\" i stood watching rachael ray\\'s talk show for 15 minutes while the cashier and an older gentleman tinkered around the kitchen and adjusted fixtures above the stove with the tongs they would use to cook my food on the grill.\\n\\nfinally, the cashier threw some chunks of meat on the cooking surface.\\n\\nthe result was a decent piece of bread filled with a handful of dry, chewy nuggets of sinewy meat.\\n\\nfries are included with the \"beta kabob sub,\" so i figured the cashier had slipped them into the frier during a particularly riveting sequence on rachael ray\\'s talk show. no. he waited until putting together my entire sub, slicing, and wrapping it, before asking whether i wanted the fries that are included with the meal. this added some additional unwanted time to an already ridiculously long wait. they did not have any bags for me to carry out my sub in, but they did try to mitigate the terrible service by offering a napkin.\\n\\nwait time for a single overcooked beta kabob sub: 30 minutes. do not order delivery from here. they are horrible. told me my order was coming then said 2 hours later that they never got it . i bartend right around the corner and will be telling everyone not to go there terrible customer service. ordered pizza took two hours for it to be delivered. ordered a pizza with various vegetables and found a single piece of pepperoni in it. which we do not eat. unless you are a desperate college student looking for food late into the night i would not recommend ordering from them. the last two times i have been there the service was awful, the appetizers were served still frozen and one person didn\\'t get their meal till 30 minutes after the table had been served... not worth it i ordered the gluten free pizza for delivery... after twice the wait time i was told to expect my delivery, my pizza arrived barely topped cold and hard as a rock. when i called, to question the reasoning behind the problems with my food, i was placed on hold, then the young lady that answered the phone said \"since i had the food, they would not refund my purchase.\" this must be the worst service i\\'ve received by delivery, and the most absurd response from a manager i\\'ve heard. horrible service, food is decent at best but overall service sucks. promised delivery to be 45 minutes and ended up more than double the time. gave them another shot and they failed again. would not recommend this place for anyone. the fact that i live down the street from them and they take the almost 2hours to deliver is outrageous. customer service doesn\\'t exist in this place. stay away. the pizza was absolutely terrible, the sauce bland, the crust was like thick cardboard and the employees were truly terrible to deal with. \\nspend your money elsewhere, you\\'ll be glad you did. i picked this particular og because it is the closest offender, geographically, to my compound.\\n\\nas succinctly as possible: you suck the life out of italian food, you bastards. you are the epitome of all that is wrong with corporate food service. the only way that you could add more salt and remove more life from your food is if you were called \"the red olive lobster garden\".\\n\\nyou suck. you know you suck. and you are killing people with your crappy food. die.\\n\\n(apparently, i have to give you 1 star. suck it.) tbh, i was quite disappointed. no gelato in the winter, very few desserts, and on top of that it was stale and very dry. as for the nutella latte, 50% foam, 30% whip cream and 20% drink. environment is small and nothing special. on the up side, server was friendly. this place was horrible. we went on lunch on thursday and were the first customers.  we got our drink orders and food orders taken care of right away.  then nothing, no coming to refill our drinks or to let us know our food was going to take a while.  we got our food after 40 minutes we immediately asked for the checks and to go boxes.  the waitress apologized for how long everything took and still took a total of 15 minutes to check us out and give us our boxes.  my g\\nfood was good, i got the spicy rigatoni.  my friends who got the spaghetti complained of the noodles having no flavor and the sauce tasted like just plain tomatoes with no seasoning at all. i called bucca to complain and they didn\\'t answer and i\\'m still waiting to hear from corporate since thursday.  very disappointed especially since this was a work birthday lunch. one star for now. wanted pizza by the slice, as advertised on their website, menu, and neon sign. don\\'t sell it on weekends. over saturated pizza had to be consumed with a knife and fork. limp and overloaded... absolutely impossible to handle, a sure sign the crust and proportion of toppings was all wrong. at $10 a slice it needs to be perfect. just like the over-engineered aria hotel where it is located, everything is massive overkill. sometimes less is more. disgusting, they brought my sandwich to our table and it was nasty looking and not appealing at all. it was obvious i did not touch the thing. two different people came to the table asking if i wanted anything different. all i wanted was it removed from in front of me because it was making me noxious. i asked for the check and paid it and left tip. i could not believe they charged me for that item. that is what i get for being nice saying it was not appealing for me rather than being honest that it looked disgusting. oh well, they will not be able to try again with me because i will not be going back and will not have anything nice to say about this place. other than my three colleagues seemed to like their pizza. luigi\\'s has been one of my favorite places to eat since moving to madison 3 yrs ago. i\\'ve eaten in and had delivery many times, but i probably won\\'t ever again. on thursday evening, i ordered delivery (directly from the luigismadison.com site). the order was placed about 6:50pm, and the confirmation indicated it should arrive around 7:20 (i live only about 4 blocks from the restaurant). my family and i had had a challenging week and weren\\'t up for cooking. the weather was nasty, so comfort food from luigi\\'s seemed the perfect option. when our food hadn\\'t arrived and we\\'d not received any calls or emails explaining the delay by 7:55, i started calling the restaurant. i don\\'t know if others were having the same problem, or what, but all i got was a busy signal for more than 5 minutes. when i finally got through (a little after 8, and already more than an hour since placing our order), i was told the food was out for delivery and should be there any moment. it was almost 15 minutes before it actually arrived--again, i live less than 3 min from the restaurant--and when it arrived (an hour later than promised) the food was cold and the order was wrong (we\\'d ordered the vegetarian version of the spaghetti pie, but there were 2 huge meatballs and very little actual spaghetti in the dish). \\n\\nwe received no explanations, no apology, nothing. on february 18 about 11:30am i stopped by for a slice of pizza with sausage and canadian bacon toppings.  in the middle of the night i woke up vomiting and diarrhea.  one slice of pizza  gave me food poisoning. this place is a lot worse than i remember....\\n\\ni used to come here before they changed everything up. it was the perfect italian lunch spot - excellent location, solid food, great service. but it seems that locale mercatto is now a shell of its former self.\\n\\nfor starters, and as others have mentioned, the entrance is hard to find. \\n\\nthe menu is a lot worse. they no longer do pizzas. they do panini sandwiches but if you ask me, that\\'s practically a write-off when you go to an italian restaurant.\\n\\nthey used to bring fresh bread to your table, they no longer do this. they even used to offer fresh parmesan with their pastas; you guessed it, they no longer do this either.\\n\\ni chose to eat the spaghetti di mare. it was okay, a little blander than expected. in fact, if you compare the picture of my dish to other reviewers, mine looks much drier and less creamy. \\n\\nwhere it really went downhill was when a couple friends ordered the dish consisting of salmon and rice. it was lukewarm at best, so we asked a server if it was supposed to be hot. she said yes, so we let her know that it wasn\\'t. she offered to have the kitchen remake it, but instead, they seemed to just throw the food in a pan, mushing everything together, breaking down the salmon. not a big deal since we\\'re not ones to complain, but it seemed unprofessional to get re-served a dish that looked the way it did (see picture). plus, we really didn\\'t need the added attitude from the other server (2 people were serving us).\\n\\nsimply put, avoid this place. one if the worst ran places ever management is lost in what they need to do. it seems like they don\\'t know what they are doing. took one hour to get two small pizza\\'s. this place is a joke. do waste your time. this was just plain bad.  it had a really overly thick crust with a thin layer of cheese and sauce.  it tasted like school lunch pizza from high school in the 80\\'s.  the sausage also tasted cheap.  i wouldn\\'t recommend this place. i will begin by saying this was my worst dining experience in as long as i can remember. since i am from ny, i have had pizza experiences galore. however, any human needing to eat needs to avoid this place.\\nfirst of all, there was no staff- just one young lady attempting to do about 4 jobs. this place needs proper staffing in a big way. she was the cashier, bartender, waiter, etc. \\nwe ordered a large pizza with 2 toppings, well done. it arrived, not well done, without sauce!!!!!!!!!!. the most tasteless, dryest, horrible pie i ever had!!!!!\\nplease avoid this place at all costs. horrible service worst customer service i have ever experienced. pizza was not was was ordered and when i called the man was very rude and could careless. the vegetables looked old and it did not have that much cheese. oh man ... this is not good pizza ... it\\'s cheap and they usually have an all you can eat lunch buffet but the \\'za is about as good as little caesar\\'s pizza (i.e. \"not so much\") tried this restaurant twice. breakfast was not good, we tried eggs benedict and poached eggs. and later we tried the bakery at night and the cheesecake and cookies were really bad. totally agree with the other reviews - service is absolutely horrendous. hostess girls are so rude and disorganized. food is ehhhh at best. i\\'ve tried this place twice hoping it was just a fluke but it\\'s definitely the norm. they don\\'t need your business or care about it - and that seems to drive their attitude you being there is an inconvenience to them. don\\'t waste your time and money to have a bad meal and bad service. this place is a mess.  called on saturday evening 6:20 pm.  10 minutes on hold, hung up.  called back and ordered 2 pizzas.  at 8:00 no pizza so a i called back, manager tells me they see that i ordered, but whoever took the order didn\\'t hit the send button.  uhhh, ok.  puts me on hold, after 10 minutes i hang up.  i call back, no apology, but took the order again and said they\\'d rush it out in 25 minutes.  an hour later no pizza, i call back.  they have no record of my order.  manager doesn\\'t know who i am.  i tell him what happened and that i had talked to the manager, he tells me they have different manager.  he asks if i want to reorder, i can tell that this is actually the manager and he does apologize.  no pizza that night.  i\\'ve ordered from this place dozens of times over the years and never had a problem, but something has changed. ordered a couple pizzas and a bottle of water for delivery from the mcknight rd pizza hut. my husband paid in cash and when he came inside i saw that we didn\\'t get the bottle of water and the pizza didn\\'t have all the ingredients on it that we asked for. when i called to have it fixed, some pizza hut operator told me that he couldn\\'t get the mcknight store to pick up the phone and that more often then not they stop answering after 9pm because they don\\'t want any more orders because the store closes at 10pm. that\\'s fine except i wasn\\'t placing a new order i was just trying to get the order that i already paid for! he told me i should try to call back the next day. seriously? ridiculous. without bashing the entire franchise, giordano\\'s is a great pizza stop on the south side of chicago. growing up 10 minutes away from the original location means you spend a lot of time there. since moving to arizona less than a year ago, i was excited to see giordano\\'s had made its way west. after trying their pizza 3 times, it proves me right that any pizza here is incomparable to chicago and it\\'s somewhat embarrassing to the original locations. nothing tastes the same and it\\'s always a long wait just to be disappointed in the product. apparently, if i want good pizza i\\'m going to have to go back home for that. they messed up the first pizza, no cheese on one side  (how that happens is beyond me). so we waited for a replacement which was even worse,  barely any sauce and less cheese than the first one.  they did give us both pizzas for the price of one else, but it should have been free. manager sandra has zero customer service and spends more time telling people how fabulous she is than serving.  she is greedy beyond belief refusing to staff any wait staff besides herself for a party of  20+.  jay the bartender is the only redeeming factor here.  but no worries for unsuspecting customers.  doors should be closed permanently by 2015. i was in toronto for a few days. i\\'m a very frequent visitor and my usual hangout is one (right across the street). i wanted to switch it up so i gave cibo a try because it was right across the street from my hotel. when i arrived the hostess asked if i had a reservation to which i replied that i didn\\'t. she then turns around to her assistant and shouts \"just a walk in\". excuse me? to paraphrase an earlier reviewer, that is a disrespectful, unacceptable, and tactless response. i had just walked in the front door and i already had a foul taste in my mouth. i was seated.\\n\\nit was around 11:45 am on a sunday, i expected their would be a brunch menu of sorts, but like most establishments, by that hour a regular lunch menu would surely be available. i was really wrong.\\n\\nnot only did they only serve brunch, apparently on sundays the brunch is available as a buffet exclusively. in other words, no table service. yet ironically i had a waitress whose only purpose was to serve drinks. i\\'m sorry, if i wanted a buffet, i\\'d go to a holiday inn. i was jet lagged from flying six hours from la and landing at seven in the morning. for the money i\\'m paying i want my food to be brought to me and frankly, buffets are pedestrian and blase.\\n\\nthen i discovered the empty water glass on my table. it was completely covered in a repulsive white film (god knows what that was), complete with lip marks. i immediately left without ordering anything. i was really disappointed with the waitress.  i seriously did not need to know it was her first day back from having the flu, and i really did not enjoy being soaked when the server dropped a tray of waters on our table and all over me. \\n\\nno one apologized, and no manager came when i asked for one. my credit card was charged $10 above the amount i signed for at this grimaldi\\'s location.  i suggest you check your credit card statement to make sure your charge is accurate. please beware, this is not italian food.  i ordered a fish special from the chalk board that claimed to come with spinach risotto.   the fish had a terrible taste and the risotto was uncle bens rice with some spinach tossed in.  i love risotto and it is supposed to be made from short grained arborio rice and should be creamy and served al dente.  this long grained rice was boiled to the point of being overcooked and simply slapped on my $29 plate.  the  more i think about it the angrier i get. \\n\\nthe mediterranean pizza was closer to but not as good as pizza pizza rather the an authentic italian pie.  \\n\\nthis restaurant may draw tourists and unwitting torontonians who don\\'t know better, but i would not go back to an italian restaurant that doesn\\'t know what risotto is. i\\'m not one to write reviews but after today i feel obligated to let everyone know of the terrible customer service that we received over the phone. from the moment i called i received nothing but complete rudeness from the employee. after asking for the employee\\'s name he refused to tell me and said \"what i am asking is beyond customer service\". when speaking to the manager, i told him what happened and he did nothing about it. stay far far away! besides pizza hut is better. three times ate there with my family three times went home vomiting!! over priced!! rude customer service .. wow get real rinaldi deli!! i can\\'t speak to the quality of the pizza here, but the rest of their food was awful. we found a little menu in our door and thought we\\'d give it a shot by ordering the buffalo chicken fingers with a side of greek fries. on the menu its listed as 10 or 6 wings for $6.99 (which doesn\\'t make a lot of sense) but when we ordered on the phone were told it was twelve for $6.99, something we confirmed three times before hanging up. the food took about an hour to show up, which isn\\'t that bad. what was bad were the fries, which were nowhere near being done. they were a wet, soggy mess and a total write off. the chicken fingers tasted like they were frozen, microwaved, then brought to us an hour later. to cap things off, this whole debacle cost $20. we asked for a couple extra ranch dips, they charged us a buck each for three of them. then they charged us $9.99 for the chicken (even though we confirmed the $6.99 price 3 times on the phone) and $2.99 for the uncooked fries. add the delivery charge and tip and we were left $20 poorer and still hungry 90 minutes later. based on this experience i wouldn\\'t dare try ordering a pizza or anything else from here. great food, but had a terrible large group experience. last year we had our staff christmas party at cibo and had such a good experience that we decided to book at cibo again this year. we had about 35 guests and did the family-style dinner. wow, were we surprised when we each received half the quantity of food compared to last year and each paid fully twice the price as last year!! unbelievable!! last year we each paid $40 each (includes gratuity, etc.) and this year we each paid over $80 each. seriously, cibo... who do you guys think you are??  teatro? ceasars steackhouse? ruth\\'s chris?  you guys serve pizza and fancy pasta... albeit very good pizza and pasta. so we will definitely not be having our staff party there next year. too bad, because they are a great restaurant with great food and atmosphere. hopefully they can make some changes. i ordered from this store online and they screwed up my order. i called and spoke to manager mike and he hung up on me because i wanted a refund instead of a credit. i called back and he admitted he hung up on me and said \"the conversation was over.\" he\\'s not management material and what good is a pizza store that can\\'t make an order correctly? order my pizza online and waited for the updates about delivery which never changed.... then a text came to my phone 19 mins after it was delivered. after getting the pizza a large two topping thin crust it was burnt, tasted stale, and the meat toppings ( which were only on one side as requested) was oily and dry. needless to say my kids were disappointed and we threw it out.  not a happy costumer. horrible customer service and crazy long wait.. it took 1:45 minutes to get my ordered pizza and wings. i even called back to see if the driver was close and the manager said he\\'d credit me for the wait.. soo i called back two days later and the rude staff said we can\\'t just give you free stuff cause your pizza took to long. you are better off going to get a frozen pizza. don\\'t waste your time or money! we did the walk up slices.  way overpriced and pizza tasted like frozen pizza.   they wouldn\\'t give tap water so had to buy bottles.   no seating and wouldn\\'t let us sit down in their patio even though it was not busy at all.   tourist trap. sent email saying pizza was on its way.  got pizza 40 minutes later.  it was cold, and not good.  i love pizza hut, but this was disgusting.  the box was gross from where pizza had sit for so long. this was the most disappointing restaurant experience i\\'ve had in a long time. though i never ate at the former location in bethel park, i wrongly assumed that an established business would have good food and good service. \\n\\nthe very young hostess seated us right by the door on a day when it was 27 degrees outside. there were at least 10 empty tables where she could have seated us. she just wanted us to sit down so that she could go back to talking to her friend who was sitting at a nearby table. \\n\\nthere was a man who i gather is the owner seated at the table next to us who heard us talk about how cold it was. he even watched me put my coat on because it was that cold. he had a small space heater at his feet and enough meat on his bones so i assume he didn\\'t notice that it was freezing. \\n\\ni looked past that because i was so excited that the pub and pizza building was finally occupied again. we anxiously waited for our server to come and take our orders. we didn\\'t wait too long. \\n\\nthe woman was friendly enough but when we asked what they have to drink, she said she didn\\'t know because she doesn\\'t have a list. we asked if they have beer and she said yes then proceeded to list off your standard dive bar drafts and a vanilla \\'port.\\' um... porter? \\n\\nwe ordered our drinks as well as a pizza and some provolone sticks. when the pizza came she put it on a wobbly pizza stand and dropped off the cheese sticks. the pizza stand was so wobbly i thought the pizza may slide off. \\n\\nthe food didn\\'t look good. the cheese sticks weren\\'t browned. they were sad, skinny sticks that were taken out of the freezer and dropped in the fryer. i\\'ve had better cheese sticks in a cafeteria. \\n\\nas for the pizza, it was terrible. soggy and shiny - two things that food should not be. i\\'m sorry but if you have \\'pizza\\' in your name, you should at least have a decent pie. it\\'s laughable considering all of the good pizza in a 2 mile radius of the joint. \\n\\nwe finished what we could and wanted to leave but our server disappeared. i went to the bar to ask if we could cash out. the bartender looked at me as if i were an alien. the owner rolled his eyes. he didn\\'t even seem to care that his employees was\\nweren\\'t taking very good care of his customers. \\n\\nrather than cash me out, the bartender went to find the server. another 5 minutes went by and she came back to take our card. \\n\\nall in all it was a bad experience. by the time we left we felt like the place didn\\'t want customers. it\\'s sad because they are in a good location. they won\\'t last long unless they do huge business selling bud light and karaoke. the worst pizza i\\'ve ever eaten! we were starving and ordered the viva las vegas. i believe the sopressata was rancid and picked it off. the crust was gooey and nasty. my bf loves meats and ate my pieces. the flavor of the meat permeated the cheese and i only ate some toppings so i had something in my tummy before attending a wine event! we left the event early as my bf started feeling ill, nauseated by the time we got home and sick all night! i had much less discomfort which was 12 delay in the resulting surprise. \\nworse than chuck e cheese!\\nthe cheap beer is the only thing that should be ordered here! the worst i mean the worst customer service. my brother came in here ordered two large pizzas for during their happy hour service, and instead of paying 12.90 for them, he was charged full price $32. i came back with him and we told the cashier we wanted the happy hour price instead of the full price. got the money back, and returned 15 mins later to them having not even started our pizzas! don\\'t catch us back here again. had the colorado lamb chops for dinner. had violent vomiting food poisoning overnight. very poor customer service. i ordered food at 6:20 pm online my order didn\\'t arrive so i called to see what was going on they said my order was cancelled because of the wrong number. keep in mind it was placed off my sisters online account. they claimed they called and she said nobody ordered pizza but she\\'s here with me. i said ok fine can i resubmit the order they said sure. 17 mins later i get a knock on the door and there is my pizza. the pizza was cold i told the driver it was ok take the pizza back and i would call and see if they can make my order fresh. i called in and the manager said oh well i can\\'t give u a discount or anything because your number is wrong. that\\'s the least you could have done. poor customer service at best please do not order from this location!! great place if you want to pay $13 for what tastes and looks like a frozen pizza. ordered the house salad with lemon vinaigrette which was way too sour and cheesy garlic bread which was decent considering we were starving. then our pizza came, a simple thin crust pepperoni pizza, which looked and tasted like a frozen pizza. it was served on cardboard... would not recommend and will never be returning. i\\'ve gone there twice, once when it first opened then again tonight.  both times extreemly disappointed.   i only went back to give it another shot since i was hopping for my first night going was just an off night.  i was wrong.  the pizza honestly was gross.  it was cold, dough is heavy and flavorless,  sauce was watered down, pepperoni was bad quality and the cheese was actually the only good part.\\nwe unfortunately left half of it and fed it to the birds outside lol.\\ni wouldn\\'t recommend this place truthfully at all.\\nworst part was the owner gave my pizza to another costumer by accident and made me wait another 15 minutes to make and other one. today was an opportunity for pizza fire to shine or it would be our last visit. we had free pizza coupons due to lousy service on our last visit. not much has changed except for the prices and the menu. coupon stated unlimited toppings. i found out that fresh mozzarella was not a topping?  so i paid the extra $, scratching my head \" if it\\'s not a topping what could it be\"? hey, i was getting a free pizza so $ wasn\\'t a big deal. if you like soggy pizza you would have loved this one. my husband always orders the unlimited or build your own pizza.  nope, not any more it is off the menu. my husbands pizza was as soggy as mine. ugh! they were a little more organized than past visits but the pizza needs to improve. looks like neapolitan pizza in the strip mall in front of costco gets my business with friendly organized staff and a nice crust. really?....tables not bussed...all of them dirty...staff goofing off. dried up chicken....straight from the grill....not.  just horrible. food stone cold. a total waste of $20. never never again at this location or any other. we went to crust a few weeks ago to celebrate a friends birthday and had an absolutely miserable experience. it was friday night around 7 o\\'clock and we were told it would be around 20 min for a table on the patio or an hour for a table inside. wasn\\'t a big deal as we were still waiting for others to join so we went to the bar to have a drink.  we checked in a few times and were assured a table would be ready soon. after an hour of waiting one of the managers told us that they had some new reservations and there would not be a table available in the foreseeable future and could be 11 o\\'clock until we were seated.  we decided to finish our drinks and head elsewhere. we signed out and were then told there were seats on the patio. this same manager then came out to chat, we asked if he could turn our tables heaters on and he let us know they couldn\\'t turn the heaters on because they were broken, and we couldn\\'t pull other tables together because it was a fire code violation. we let him know that we were unhappy with the experience and he said he would send his gm out.  she then came out and it really went downhill. i have never encountered someone so condescending in the service industry as this gm. she was extremely rude and more interested in arguing whether we waited an hour or an hour and fifteen minutes then doing anything productive to fix the situation. when we told her we were going to leave and not be back due to our experience she smiled and sarcastically told us \"thank you, have a good night\".  hopefully they are able to provide some training to fix the poor management at this restaurant. it was a relatively small issue that could not have been handled any worse and led to a miserable experience. well me and my kids or should i say family like to go to this place they did a whole lot better before it became gianni\\'s now you don\\'t know when they\\'re open you call nobody answers got a take-out menu here says they\\'re open sunday through thursday 11 am to 9 pm friday and saturday 11 am to 10 pm so why is it when you call nobody answers guess were going to have to find a new place ordered this after 12 midnight. asked for pepperoni with extra sauce and chicken fingers. the order was expected to be delivered in 45 min, it took 15. that was the only positive part of our experience. the fingers were dry and burnt... i mean black on one side, not just overcooked. the pizza is horrible. barely any toppings, spongy crust. i will never order from them again. disgusting. not worth it, i forgot why i haven\\'t ordered from here in years. now i remember after todays carryout.  watered down marinara.  dry breadsticks. undercooked pizza. and messed up order (they forgot one of my toppings - bacon).  see photo.  i didn\\'t call them  to rectify the problem, they\\'d probably give me the run around for their mistake and having to wait for my correct order, yeah, no, i was too starved to wait.  papa makes better pizza. always papa from now on. i cant recommend this place to anyone since the food is prepared by amateur cooks who dont mind serving leftovers for the next day nor are they very aware and acquanited with food safety handling regulations. the thing that caused a friend of mine to get food poising and diahrrea after ordering a kefta sandwitch. \\nnot ordering from there again! and we reallly missed the previous owner \\'salems halal\\' who moved to the strip district. the pizza wasn\\'t that great at all and neither was the weird garlic bread. \\nwouldn\\'t recommend at all. very bad services charges for ranch and manger sitting there doing nothing really i had to wait ten minutes for my order i\\'ll start by saying the pizza is really great here and so is the pasta easily four stars. ive been here a few times, and everyone was helpful. do not get the girl server with the forehead bangs she ruined our experience. \\n\\nterrible service. wow. came in saturday with a couple of girlfriends, and our server was absolutely terrible. she took forever to bring us our menus, even longer to get our drinks out. it\\'s not like she was even busy she was just screwing around on her phone at the end of the bar. we finally get her to come to the table and she was abrupt and short with us when answering some of the questions we had about the menu. when the food finally did come she practically slammed the plates down. my girlfriend didn\\'t have silverware and again, we had to flag her down for ten mintues so we could enjoy the meal. didn\\'t get refills once, she didn\\'t come by to ask how everything was. we weren\\'t even half way through the meal when she dropped off the check, we still had a to go order to place and were thinking about dessert. we were long finished before she came back again and was really rude with us when we told her we needed to place two chicken parm dinners to go and she snachtched up the checkbook so fast. don\\'t know what her problem was. we asked for her superior but she told us he wasn\\'t available, i\\'ll talk to him next time we go in and he\\'ll get an earful. first time visiting after seeing them on restaurant impossible. it\\'s a shame they learned nothing from robert irvine. maria was the first one we met, she was not friendly. she didn\\'t even greet us and 20 minutes after sitting down, she threw bread on our table. gasper was not friendly either, after snapping a picture, he rolled his eyes and turned his back on me. the bartender was rude to the waitress. i did not like how he talked down to her. after 30 minutes of no service, we decided to leave. nice decor, bad service. visited l\\'acadamie with my mother recently since i had been here once before and remembered it was a byob. the restaurant can be deceiving from the outside but there are three stories and it can handle a lot of people. we went somewhat early on a friday night and it was packed already. since there are three floors the noise level got to be a bit much but it wasn\\'t the reason why i would only give this place two stars. \\n\\ni ordered the mussels marinier and my mother ordered the gnocchi gorgonzola. the meal was pretty good, food wise but the service was terrible. there was one guy who gave us water and bread, another guy that opened our bottle of wine and then a third who was our actual waiter. not once after receiving our food did our waiter return to check on our food or ask us if we needed anything but he had to pass our table multiple times in order to bring out food to other tables, clear things, etc. so it wasn\\'t like we were in the back of the restaurant and he had forgotten about us--it just showed he didn\\'t care. \\n\\nsince we were planning on having a leisurely dinner anyways we didn\\'t realize how late it was and how long we had been sitting there after finishing our food until all the wine was gone and we had run out of things to say. in total, we were there for 1 1/2 hours! it took us nearly 10 minutes to try and get our waiter\\'s attention just to get the cheque! and when we did he started to clear our dishes and took away my mom\\'s pasta dish which was more than half uneaten without asking if she wanted it wrapped up--we thought it was very rude of him to assume that an uneaten plate of food was to be tossed in the dumpster. he also did not ask if we wanted dessert or coffee/tea which meant he made less on the tip. overall, terrible service from our waiter (adil) and since we had to fight tooth and nail to get his attention, my mom thought he deserved no tip at all. he never once checked up on us, asked if we needed anything, nor did he generally show that he was working for his pay. this is the first time we haven\\'t left a tip but he deserved it. i went there this past week at 8pm, primetime dinner dining, and there was no one in the restaurant. a lady was in the kitchen and wouldn\\'t come out to welcome or greet us. waited for a good 5 minutes until deciding they did not want business. big disappointment. i have given this place 2 tries and they are just terrible. the sauce here taste funny and the overall pizza was not good. the worst thing about this place is the wait times. the last time i order over the phone app and it said my pizza was ready for pickup at 6:10pm. i got there right on time and watched them hand my order to the person in front of me. they then had to remake my order which made me wait there for 20 minutes. it seems every casino must have a steak house and an italian restaurant.\\n\\ncontinuing the great las vegas tradition of uninventiveness and mediocrity, marinelli\\'s is the italian eatery at the new m resort. \\n(by the way, the steak house is called terzetto...which frankly sounds like another italian restaurant to me.)\\n\\nif last night\\'s meal at marinelli\\'s is any indication, the m resort is not much of a player in the intense competition for our gullets.\\n\\nthe decor: whoever designed the room should be sent to guantanamo for unconscionable acts of aesthetic terrorism. it looks and feels like a buffet with too-small tables and a generically psychedelic carpet (all the better to hide the stains i guess). \\n\\nspeaking of stains:  the bar at the front is odd. the counter was designed with a 4 inch slope on the outside edge. i guess cuz it looks nice. \\nit wasn\\'t so nice, however,  when i watched a man put his glass of beer down, then a second later see it slide off and break on the floor.\\n\\nthe food: my steak was overcooked and had the consistency of a piece of choice-beef from vons. my friend\\'s osso bucco was cold and tasteless. my other friend didn\\'t finish his risotto. \\n\\ni\\'m struggling to find something positive to say....hmmmm, let me think....okay, okay i got it...the bread was pretty good. the rest of the experience was forgettable.\\n\\nthe resort in general: it\\'s nice although it doesn\\'t look like a billion dollars to me. it\\'s rather red rockish in overall feel. \\nthe bar upstairs at veloce has a nice view...although they weren\\'t equipped to make absinthe in the proper way. \\n\\nmy favorite part of the complex was the hostile grape: a comfortable, stylish room with a very good selection of wines by the glass, including a sine qua non that is almost never available by the glass. those of you who know wine, know what i mean.\\nalthough i must warn you, the snq is $49.50 an ounce.....or maybe i should say it\\'s $49.50 an ouch!\\n\\ni\\'m not a buffet guy but the buffet at m resort looked interesting. the line-up was certainly long enough. \\nit\\'s called studio b and appears to combine the usual buffet experience with \"show kitchen\" entertainment where you see dishes being prepared. perhaps i\\'ll put a bag over my head and check it out one day. so i told 3 of my friends about $10 tuesday..we usually go out to dinner together once a month. so we planned this about a month ago and the sisters i guess found a coupon for a free pizza (i have no idea what the coupon says). so we are seated and hand waitress coupon they order there cheese pizza i\\'m next and said $10 cheese and sausage you can\\'t have that price with coupon ok i\\'ll sit at another table cause your pizza isn\\'t worth $20 waitress says you can\\'t do that. our other friend can\\'t have red sauce of course they don\\'t have white cheese pizza anyways it goes on  what my problem is , is that the waitress sees we are upset and doesn\\'t say anything but negatively. a great waitress  (customer service) would of said oh this might work for you and this price would be better..nothing ..none of us will be back.. i had high expectations with the line out the door. maybe the other food is good but the lamb burger was completely dried out, the greek sauce on top was a joke it was disgusting with huge chunks of onion and no flavor, the bun was flavorless as well maybe skip their specialties and stick with the common menu. sorry, don\\'t like this place. prices are high for what you\\'re getting, and hotdogs are crappy quality. it\\'s \"all american\" but not in the good way. fries are overly salty and overall quite flavourless. been here a few times with friends, and i\\'m usually not too picky about eating with friends (other places around are fine) but i actively ask them to not go to this place, even though i\\'m fine with nearly anything else in oakland. ok this review is from two years ago, but i only started using yelp recently. this is not even a food review..we walked out prior to being served. if your not a regular or a goombah, then you really don\\'t need to eat here unless you like getting ignored and pissed. took my dad her on his vegas visit and we were seated in the corner room of their old place. there was a big party in the main room, but we were seated and then nobody even gave us menu\\'s for 15 minutes and then after nobody else came over to take my order, i just flipped out on the idiot owners there. his lame apology was pathetic and i really wanted to punch him that night for sorta ruining the evening. bootlegger bistro saved the night. who cares how good the food is if you can\\'t even get a waiter to your table on a half-empty weekend night. just like the sahara,, this piece of mob history needs to be imploded or give me some owners who care about new customers. no bathrooms i have to live because i have two babies plus i\\'m a look at the wood in the line went to this place several times when first opened. good pizza and good service. the last two times was poor. went yesterday (10/24) called in a carry out. rep stated 15-20 mins. arrived---no pizza stated 5 more mins,-- no problem. i waited and waited and waited and waited. 45 mins later it was ready with no apologize, nothing. i asked several times how much longer, each time 5 mins. end result: poor customer service, pizzas were wrong when i got home but they were good. it was apparent by looking thru the glass of the pizza making process several new people were working but not trained well. would not suggest this place considering there is about a dozen pizza joints within 2 miles. but this would be a good location to open a real pizza restaurant. terrible rude people!!  will never go there again and ripped me off too!!!   dough was hard and cheese tasted terrible.  skimpy on the pepperoni. waited to order and the staff were arguing and went behind the doors and when they fi ally came out they asked the customer behind me for their order... it was very strange... they said i was there 1st and they still ignored me... maybe they thought i was a student but i was so turned off by this behaviour i left and will refuse to go again. the worst showcase of service i have ever experienced our group made a reservation and they alowed another group to take over the room we reserved thinking they would be done before we got there. the other group remained for quite some time and they had no where else to seat us. ended up sitting outside, sweating. sun started to go down and it started to sprinkle on us. super fun. took 2 hours from when we arrived to receive our salads. immediately boxes up our food and left. will never be coming back. ordered two dishes took nearly two hours too deliver. i live on the same street.  unreal.    food was below average as well.  too many options on bayview to waste your time here.\\nanyone who gives this place 3-5 stars is either an employee, friend or a family member.\\n\\navoid this place... i had hear good things about this restaurant so i went expecting good food, instead i was seated and sat for over 20 minutes. no one asked if we wanted something to drink never mind take our order. after 3 tables were cleared and re set we left.  i guess they don\\'t need more customers, too bad for them.... we just bought a house in the neighborhood. it was my first trip to vegas and of the 4 days, this restaurant was the #1 most disappointing part of the trip. please go to a different restaurant. \\n4 girls total who ordered similar things: 3 girls ordered the linguine and replaced the clams with shrimp. ($24)\\n\\ni personally ordered the agio e olio ($14) and added shrimp (+$6) - it was embarrassingly horrible. oil was splattered to try and mask the low-quality, dry pasta. even an attempt to make the dish tolerable by adding spices did not work at all. it was beyond disappointing. \\n\\nthe other 3 dishes were just as dry. one of the girls ordered alfredo sauce as a replacement to the original and let\\'s just say, they all looked the same.\\n\\nnone of us finished.\\n\\nour conversations at the table consisted on how much better we could have made pasta, and how awful our waiter was. while asking for drink options, we merely said water. to which he asked sparkling or regular. we said regular and that was it. he brings out a bottle and slaps on a $19 charge for 2 bottles water. of course we complained and got that taken off, but we should have also complained about our food. that was one of our biggest regrets.\\n\\n\\nall in all: do not come here. there are so many better restaurants. even across the restaurant is a much better looking restaurant. please don\\'t waste your money.\\n\\nus 4 will remember this place as the worst italian restaurant we have all been to. came here for my dad\\'s birthday tonight. ok service, but the waiter took my dad\\'s drink to refill and never gave it back, even after asking again. we usually get my dad\\'s favorite dish that is now off the menu, but they make it for us anyway. tonight, they didn\\'t, which is understandable because it\\'s not on the menu anymore, but they made some weird excuse about being out of ingredients that were never present in the dish. we chose the penne san remo, which was flavorless and not that appetizing. we barely touched it. the noodles are supposed to be al dente, which i love, but were really undercooked. a lady who i\\'m assuming is the manager came over to ask how are meal was, and when we told her about the hard pasta, she told us that\\'s how they do it so next time order it another way. funny, because we have been here plenty of times before and it was never like that??? the family next to us complained about the noodles as well, but the manager didn\\'t seem to care. place has gone downhill, and it\\'s sad, because we have been coming to this place since i was a little girl. won\\'t be coming back. do not go here if you have any self respect.  the staff is pathetic....you have to ask for service......beg for things like silverware.....they serve bread with no bread plates or napkin.....they are clueless at this restaurant(?)....the manger is even worse.....he has no idea how to train the staff or run a dinner service.......when i complained to the manager about the horrible experience i was having the table next to me began applauding because they were having the same experience......enough said! went for dinner today at 4pm the place was empty, 2 of us arrived and we were not acknowledged by the waiter for 10 mins  he came over and we order drinks and water told him we were waiting on one more person she came in he walked by the table 2 times before he came over he looked at her and started to walk away we called he didn\\'t answer he finally came back and the gentleman at another table flagged him down for us, i told him he we were talking to him and he just walked away stated i didn\\'t hear you so he took her drink order.  he came back we ordered the food arrived and it was lacking to say the least.  it was terrible the chicken spinach cannelloni was swimming in horrible tasting cheese there may have been 4 chunks of chicken in it, had stuffed mushrooms which were so mushy and undercooked.  when we asked this waiter what was in our drinks and the mushrooms he acted as tho it was a problem to tell us. he was  not a good waiter at all, i forget his name.  i will not return neither will the two ladies that were with me.  the food is very pricey for what you get i could\\'ve done much better at this dish!!!!  i am glad at least i had a 15.00 off coupon or i would of been even more upset.  i don\\'t care much for olive garden but it is 50x better than this place.  do not waste your time or money. poor service.  waited an hour for food.  server told us it was because we didn\\'t order appetizers...hmmm.  overpriced. for a restaurant in my neighborhood that i have eaten at for years this was my last meal there. love the vodka sauce but too many other restaurants that appreciate my business. gave me a 45 to 60 min delivery time.  called them after an hour and was told it just got in the oven.  i got my order 1.5 hours after delivery just to be told they didnt have soda.  i was handed 2 one dollar bills at the door.  they had an hour and a half to let me know they werr out of diet soda so thar maybe i could pick somthing else.  this places service is a joke. we\\'ve ordered from big man\\'s for years and have noticed a steady decline in the quality. tonight they promised delivery in 45 mins but it was 2 hours. we called twice and they said it would be 5 minutes but it wasn\\'t true. when it finally arrived the pizza was cold and the salad was wilted. no credit or discount offered either. we won\\'t be back. 2 hours to get a pizza?  really?  on a monday?  and it\\'s not like it\\'s gourmet pizza...never again. worst $30 i have spent in a minute. sooooo they closed the kitchen earlier before the schedule close time!!! i ask if i could order something to go since they close in 30 mins ... the waiter said the kitchen was close .... sooooo should you list your close time at 10:30pm...  omg ... horrible!!! the worst meal i\\'ve had in a long time and the most expensive disappointment ever. we went early on sunday and were served day old food -bread & fish & all got sick... with a bill of $114 dollars for 3 of us.  i had an appetizer & house salad.\\n the house salad consisted of 1/3 cup of greens and one slice of a plum tomato - are you kidding me !!! the eggplant parmesean consisted of one piece - 1/3\" slice of a medium eggplant, cut lengthwise, topped w/ one generous ladle of heated up, uncooked crushed tomato with basil and 3 oz of cheese. it was $16.95.\\n my friend got the chef\\'s special - salmon, about 6-8 oz with 4 shaved strips of zucchini, 2 slices of plum tomato, 2 overcooked shrimp and some olives and a house salad. her wine was fabulous though.\\n my other friend got soup & dinner portion of lasagna & it was the size of a single thin burrito on a lunch menu at a mexican restaurant. \\n after reading the other comments, we were really excited to go and were distressed by the experience. we were going to come home and eat but were not feeling well by the time we arrived. wish i could give less than 1 star.  worst pizza hut delivery experience ever.  i understand i\\'m not spending $50 for pizza, however i live less than 2 miles away and it took them 1.5 hours to get here.  how is that even possible?  i checked in with the store after 45 min and they assured me it would be here within 10 min....twice...then i gave up.  if it was just me, it wouldn\\'t be such a big deal, but when you have guests its matters. i\\'ve had this a few times since.  delivery takes forever, customer service is god awful.  seriously, these people are such assholes.  you get what you pay for, and this place is still a ripoff.  should never be more than a star. save your money and go to olive garden.\\nyou will get the same quality and \"interpretation\" of italian without  the feeling or regret after spending so much.\\n\\nthe linguini with clams was in a pool of butter and oil, but the pasta was all stuck together.  it should be illegal to call a pizza of such quality a \"margarita\", with its flat pita bread crust, thick rubbery cheese and no basil in sight.  \\n\\nthis place highlighted all that is wrong with americanized italian food.  greasy, heavy, over cheesed, and over cooked.\\n\\nthe one star is because they had really comfortable chairs. domino\\'s has ruined my night. i got home late, my delivery had just shown up, the number they had on file didn\\'t know there was a pizza coming. i call the store for fifteen minutes, at least ten times-no answer! finally they answer their phone and then proceed to tell me the driver was too scared to come back to my house, actual words \"he said it was dark and he felt uncomfortable\" then the manager added the store was about to close, so all in all, my pizza cannot be delivered. i understand the manager cannot make his child of a driver deliver my pizza if he claims to be \"uncomfortable\", so i still want my pizza, and decide to go down myself for my now at least 20 minute late pizza-mmm, yum. plus, it\\'ll be nice to put a face to this driver who must be 12-yrs-old.\\ni get there, no one is up front when they knew i was coming! i literally waited three minutes before the driver noticed a customer up front and all he did was call for the manager and go back to the back. guess what? he looked to be about 35 years old, what the-i\\'m really trying not to curse throughout this review, but i am livid. the manager comes up, looking like he\\'s now the one scared of me, and by the way, this guy looks to be around 18. not that he\\'s too young to be a manager but he was obviously lacking confidence and intelligence from the whole scenario i\\'m having with him.\\ni\\'m just wondering a few things. not why they have jobs at all, that would be mean, though the driver really needs to look into a new job if he can\\'t drive to a normal looking neighborhood at night, definitely a poor choice for his career. but i\\'m also wondering why no one was checking the front more frequently, there was an extremely easily accessible donation jar in my reach the entire time. someone could easily walk in and walk out. why my phone calls weren\\'t answered until they were almost closed-actually i was definitely calling longer than 15 minutes. i actually did ask him why they never answered the phone, his response was he was counting the inventory in the walk-in. are you kidding me!? your phone is ringing repeatedly during the span of a few minutes, you really aren\\'t going to stop and answer?? or if you couldn\\'t hear it your employee couldn\\'t tell you the phone was ringing repeatedly!!!!!!??!!?!??!???!?!?!!\\nwhy the hell are these two the only ones in the store on a friday night!?!?!?!?? -honestly, all this was just pasted from my facebook post.\\nas a follow up, i was able to get a hold of the store\\'s gm this morning to tell him about the five charges i found on my bank account, essentially he solved my problem, refunding the money and also giving my a credit for my next pizza with them, but i was unimpressed by the feel i got from him on the phone.\\n i really need the dm to be aware that this particular store seems to be falling apart and may need to be checked on.\\n\\nnames of domino\\'s staff that \"helped\" me:\\njustin-gm\\nandre-manager on duty\\nshane-driver last time i was at an olive garden was 7 years ago. i seem to remember that it being good then. so i recommended it to our out of town guests.\\nit was 3:30 in the afternoon and there were very few diners in the restaurant. yet, we still waited over 10 mins for anyone to take our drink order. strike 1! \\nthe server took our food order and went away. she came back 5 mins later explaining that she forgot to ask us if we would like the soup or salad. we had a table of 7. two guests order the soup, the rest ordered salad. she brought all salad. strike 2!\\nfood took a long time to come but we chatted and it didn\\'t bother us. \\nnow the food...i had the chicken marsala and i swear it came straight out a box. the rest of my guests felt their food was high priced and very underwhelming. strike 3!\\ni apologized to my friends about the bad choice of restaurant.\\nwe won\\'t be returning. although the service was charming and ambiance lovely - the food was disappointing. the roasted olive appetizer and wine selection was good. our three entrees and two salads were not good. pizza was cooked to a frisbee-hard disk; fra diavolo\\npasta was mushy and shrimp fishy; chicken pasta was a hard balls of stuck- together noodles and rubber bird meat. if we had time to spare we would have sent all three entrees plus the two salads back to the kitchen. so many choices in downtown phx - skip this one! i was upset that a waiter tried to take advantage of us; it ruined what would have been a good night.\\n\\ni went here for winterlicous and ordered a long island ice tea.  the waiter brought me coke in a high ball glass; there was clearly no alcohol. i alerted the waiter to the mistake, but he said he made it himself and it was fine. so i left it full on the table for the duration of the meal (the food was edible, like a red lobster or swiss chalet).  at the end of the meal, the waiter avoided our table for half an hour clearly foreseeing that i would request to speak with the manager. apparently the manager wasn\\'t in (likely..) but i could speak with one of the cooks who\\'s worked there for a while.  so i did, and he concluded based on the fact that the colour of the liquid in my glass was very dark that i was not drinking a long island ice tea.  my drink was refunded, but it\\'s concerning that the same waiter still works there.. (i pass by sometimes and see him inside). terrible. waited 30 minutes to order. an hour for a food. then they double charged everyone, said tip was included but charged everyone wrong. and the food wasn\\'t worth it. don\\'t go here, especially with a big party. worst pizza place ever. the pizza slice is very hard to chew. i think they must put it for more than one day. it\\'s cheap but tastes horrible. terrible! the delivery took 2 hours. we called to check because we had guests and our 4 year old all asking where our food was. we were told it was almost here but took 25 mins more and it doesn\\'t take 25 mins to drive that distance. the delivery woman was very rude and when we asked if it was hot (it wasnt) she just said angrily, \"you want it or not!?\" well, we had to feed everybody who was hungry so we took it. both pizzas were cold as if they had been sitting for a while, yet the crust was undercooked and doughy. how the hell did it take so long to undercook pizzas? worst of all, all the cannolis were melted and so warm we couldn\\'t serve them. waste of $50. i want my $ back. doesn\\'t even deserve the one star.\\n\\ni don\\'t generally give bad review\\'s, but my experience here was inexcusable.\\n\\nservice was horrible, with a forced smile from the waitress only when giving us the bill. waited on table bread for 1 hour, but it never came. restaurant wasn\\'t busy at all, but our appetizers took 75 minutes to come out. followed by two flavorless pies with the least amount of toppings possible, even for a neapolitan style pizza.\\n\\nsave your money, and stick to the pizzerias that do it best in this city. queen margarita, pizzeria libretto, etc.. the food was good but the restaurant was so dirty it was disgusting. there was dried pop on the window frame and wall. all of the seats were also ripped.  don\\'t mention the bathroom. we went to hp because both couples had groupon and upon ordering, informed the waiter of the groupon situation and if it was ok?  he replied it was good but  he would have to give us separate checks to honor the groupon and everyone was in agreement.  at the end of the meal the waiter said \"oops,\" the manager said they could not honor the second groupon because we were at the same table.  i asked to speak to the \"manager.\" and that individual informed us the waiter made a mistake and only one groupon would be honored. this \"manager,\" was out of his element in dealing with customers and i had the feeling he was just filling in.  the thing that made the situation even worse was after writing twice to the humble pie headquarters to tell of our experience...there was no response.  mind you i am not looking for a free lunch but was only pointing out our negative experience in hopes it would not happen to others but it fell on humble but deaf ears.  no one cares what happens here and we do not care to return. last time the pizza was bomb... this time it was suuuuper fucking greasy and the bread was so thin you couldn\\'t even lift the slice without it breaking off/sliding ... lame... walked from ceasars specifically for this slice... what a bummer by far the worst bar service anywhere ever.\\n\\ni\\'ve been here frequently for trivia, sometimes it\\'s busy, so a little wait is expected, but even on busy nights, the bartenders spend more time socializing with each other, with customers already served, and sometimes with other bartenders who aren\\'t working, but drinking. last time, it was not very crowded, at all, maybe half the people that are normally there. was the service more prompt? absolutely not. this was even more frustrating, because the lack of attention was even more obvious. their food is good, and the kitchen staff works quickly and brings it to your table. if the older blonde lady is behind the bar when you walk in, you might as well turn around and leave, unless you want an 80/20 split of your standing around waiting and drinking time. if i could give it less than 1 star i would. domino\\'s \"online only\" 50% off all pizzas at menu price 11/25 thru 12/4 \"this store is currently unavailable for online ordering.\" been like this for all wisconsin stores since the promotion started. so the food at this place is good. well the sliced turkey sud. but when it came to delivery and internet ordering. oh my god the incompetence of these people. after and hour, 15 mins after the food was suppose to be delivered (the order was 2 turkey subs and garlic cheese bread.) i called and was told that there was no delivery guy and if i can come pick it up that they would knock off 25%. but the foods not ready yet, how long does it take to make 2 subs. so i pick up the goods and damned if i didn\\'t check the bag they didn\\'t give me the 2nd sub. ugh they never checked the order. if you have online ordering  you need to follow though. so with a second phone call and a second trip to the place and 2 hrs after the original order i finally get home and eat. the only good thing i got was a free lunch.  for that i give them a 1 horrible.  empty tables and still long wait.  waiters fighting with each other over tables. bad service at bar or no service.  and someone blew chunks in the women\\'s bathroom all over the floor and this was dinner service at 6pm do not go here worst pizza place in town  if rocco isn\\'t in the store run the other way.  very inconsistent! pizza will be burned one day and the next the crust will be under cooked and soupy,  worth zero stars. my 11 year old saved up babysitting money to order her and her friend pizza and when it arrived the delivery driver told her he was short on change. and did not give her the correct amount of change back. we\\'ve ordered from them in the past and it was always good.  expensive, but good.  tonight was a whole different story.  the guy who answered the phone was confused, sort of like he was a customer and heard the phone ringing so he grabbed it.  the next guy got our address wrong 3 times (there\\'s only 4 numbers in it).  \\n\\nfood gets here and, well, it just wasn\\'t good.  we ordered extra cheese on our pizza and got about 1/2 as much as normal.  we ordered wedding soup.  i have no idea what it was that we got, but it was gross.  it was like some canned chicken broth, little pasta, 3 tiny meatballs, weird green stems and scrambled eggs.  basically yellow swill with green stems floating in it.  blech!\\n\\nthe pizza that really had no taste was $16.50.  the giant eagle throw in the oven pizzas are much better than this was tonight.\\n\\ni think we\\'ll be crossing sainatos off of our pizza place list.  $40 is too much to gamble with for pizza. just had a ridiculous interaction with linda, the owner, over a $7 groupon coupon. sad really. there are so many pizza places; she needs to appreciate it\\'s the little things that keep customers happy just awful.. first off a manger who personally insulted the way i raise my kids when we were there, dirty tables, a lack of any hospitality. they need to consider hiring a manger who wasn\\'t a high school drop out. what a incompetent guy and the sole reason this place is being ruined. blah!  get your grease bomb gut busters here! the most positive reviews are for what used to be tony\\'s lounge, next door. the lounge is now called jack\\'s place, and it\\'s great for a beer and some decent food. last night we ordered from this location, my pizza had hair in it. this is after the delivery guy attempted to hold on to $20 in a tip and we had to gang up on him to get it back. then when they redelivered the pizza over 30 mins later,  it still came with hair. i think it\\'s absolutely ridiculous and nasty for kitchen workers not to wear gloves or hairnets and still deal with cash. this location and the workers are disgusting and they should be closed down before they get someone really sick. stopped by for a late lunch and found an overpriced, unpleasant atmosphere staffed by mostly disinterested loud servers.  perhaps it is better during brunch hours but for lunch it was pretty bad.  there are quite a few options in the same strip so pick another spot. not sure what these positive reviewers had... but we had the worst pizza ever here. it was literally bread and cheese, we hardly had any sauce. wanted to like this place since it\\'s close but nope won\\'t be going back one thing a hungry girl should never forget - if the restaurant is empty (it was lunch hour nonetheless) there is a reason!  i dined all alone at piccadilly freemont - and not because i\\'m a lonely thirty-something spinster!  well, i guess i am a lonely thirty-something spinster - but that\\'s not why i dined alone.  trust me, this joint was empty for good reason.  \\n\\nthis place is just awful.  i don\\'t know what brand of frozen pizza they toss in the microwave to serve their patrons, but i can assure you it\\'s on the low-end of the freezer-section pizza spectrum.  i ordered the $5.99 special - 2 cheese slices and a 16 oz soda and it seemed like a bargain until i got my food.   i looked at those puffy, pitiful, slices of pizza  crusted over with a few shreds of cheese, and my heart sank.  moments like these make me pause and wish i was more of an outspoken trouble maker.  i wish i had the nerve to thrust my chin forward and demand my money back.  however, since i am about as spineless as a gummy bear that\\'s been sitting in the sun for an hour, i took my sad little lunch and ate all whilst plotting my yelp revenge.  \\n\\nthey couldn\\'t even get my diet coke right.  the 16 oz cup was filled to the brim with ice and perhaps 3 sips of soda.  how very disappointing.  i expected better freemont street!  well, not really.  i guess i should have known i was strolling down the boulevard of tourist traps.  i\\'m ashamed that, as a local las vegan, i didn\\'t have the sense to keep on strolling.\\n\\ndo yourself a favor folks, skip this joint.  it\\'s a waste of calories! if there were a way to do no stars then, i would choose it! they are some of the most clueless unorganized people ever. the last 3 attempts to order something there, they have been out of stock, gotten it wrong, or taken forever to deliver it! i wrote the corporation, and the then so-called \"manager\" reached out to me and gave me a $15 credit. i just tried to call and redeem it tonight, and they don\\'t have any recollection or documentation of my credit. they are just absolutely terrible and i am never wasting my time there again! so we ordered some drinks at the bar and bought some slices of pizza to enjoy as a snack only to be told that you can\\'t eat slices at the bar. why didn\\'t you say that before we ordered. can\\'t stand job worths!! . this place is the worst! i would not recommend anyone to come here. we came on a friday night around 7 o\\'clock. we were told it would be about a 20 minute wait. after almost an hour of waiting a manager came up to tell us how \"transparent\" he would be and that we could expect a table around 11:00 pm. the entire patio was open except for one table. we were told that due to fire code we could not pull tables together. then a table opened up inside that we were told we could sit at got bumped for a reservation. finally after an 1:15 minutes we were sat outside. our waitress was incredibly friendly and took good care of us. unfortunately the same manager that told us we could get a table at 11:00 pm came out to chat. i asked if he could do anything to help rectify the situation. he told me he would send his gm out. she came out and this is where the night went really south. i have never come across a more condescending, rude employee in my life. she had zero compassion and talked down to us the entire time. we expressed that we would not be back due to our experience and she did not care. due to her lack of compassion and condescending tone we will never be back again and i would recommend you do the same. crust served its guests expired food. you can find this out this factual info on the maricopa esd website. i already posted the link but crust paid to take the review down. so i will continue on a weekly basis to post the failing health inspections until they find it to expensive to do so and just leave the 1 review i leave. this place is as much italian as pizza hut.  server was very nice but the food is bad.  they want $12.00 for a small linguine \"dinner\" that includes nothing.   i asked for a side salad and i got a few pieces of lettuce in a bowl right out of the cooler for an additional $2.50.  i asked for bread and they do not have bread unless i want to order it off the appetizer menu.   what real italian place serves a meal without bread!!  if you like pizza hut stye food this is the place for you.  i am staying far away. the reason for the one star is simply due to the attitude and service of the people that work here. rude on the call in order, rude when picking up and not a thank you in sight. no offering of napkins, choice of dressing on a salad or utensils. with all the choices in vegas, the owner had better have a talk with the employees. i will go elsewhere. i\\'m a host at a restaurant on the strip and as important as having good food at a restaurant is, having good customer service is just as important, if not more. i dined here on a saturday night with two friends, we figured it would be polite to call and reserve in advance. when we arrived, on time, i told the hostesses my name for the reservation and without a word spoken to me, i was handed a buzzer. we didn\\'t wait long before we got a table, but the hostess said only one word to us when she sat us, \"enjoy\". it seemed rushed and very ingeniune. we didn\\'t even get so much as a smile out of her. \\n\\nnext, our waiter arrived and got right to the point of taking our order. i tried asking which flavor of italian soda would be best and he basically told me they\\'re all gross. i picked one at random anyway and it was delicious. \\n\\nwe waited and waited for the always anticipated bread sticks and we got both our appetizers and our meals before we finally saw our waiter again (the food runner delivered everything) and we asked for our bread sticks. the manager promptly arrived to apologize for this mishap and said we would receive them shortly. he also offered us all a free dessert on the house as an apology. \\n\\nan extra salad plate was brought by who was described to us as our waiters partner, but i told him we didn\\'t need or want one. he shoved it toward me and said to take it anyway \"just in case\". it was in my way while i tried to rearrange our other plates to make room for the unwanted plate. \\n\\nour bread sticks finally arrived just as we finished our meals and were too full to eat more than a bite of them. we asked for boxes for our appetizers and as we prepared to scoop the brushetta into the container we came across a hair inside it. i had been snacking on this my whole meal. yum. i tried telling my waiter about the hair and i had to repeat myself because he wasn\\'t listening the first time. the manager arrived again to apologize and offered to make a new brushetta to take home.\\n\\nalthough the managers attempted to make up for the problems, the complete lack of customer service combined with the ridiculously late bread sticks and the hair in my food, it was an overall dissapointing and regretful experience.\\n\\ni will not be returning to this olive garden after being a faithful customer their for the past 5 years. 2 strikes i\\'m out.\\n\\ni pass this place quite often, but was kinda leery due to the plaza that it was located in but thought to give it a try anyway. first time i went there i ordered a cheese steak, which was bland as could be. i also didn\\'t care much for the service , for it being not crowded i expected a little more prompt and friendly attitude. so that was try #1, a month later i had a craving for wings and was in the area so stopped in. figured wings are an easy enough dish not to screw up, guess i thought wrong. ordered the parmesan wings which were bland and had no real taste. after 2  attempts with below avg outcomes i decided to seek future meals elsewhere. worst olive garden ever!!! bad service, server spilt drinks on our table, brought out wrong food, left a order off the ticket i\\'ll never go here again. they screwed up my order the first time and then proceeded to charge my bankncatf ecgta money for a tip when i gave them a great tip even though they screwed up. i never agreed to an extra card charge and they charged anyways.  it\\'s not worth a damn bit of your money and make sure you dont use your bank card cause they will charge without your agreement. disappointing to say the least.  first off why are we\\ntold that since we don\\'t have a reservation it will be a 10-20 minute wait and then when we\\'re finally seated the restaurant is half full.  some of the food is passable but seriously...season your food!  even adding pepper  and salt couldn\\'t hide the lack of flavour in the dishes. service is friendly and efficient...that was the saving grace...however not enough to warrant a second visit. this pizza joint offers a lunch buffet which i tried to have last week. i stopped in at 12:15 or so. no buffet. i asked the person working at the front about it and she said they were running behind and would have it out soon. so i sat down to wait a bit. after 10-15 minutes it was clear no buffet soon. so i went a few doors down to bobbie o\\'s bbq and had their as usual great pulled pork sandwich. \\n\\ni had to walk past this place on the way back to my car 20 minutes later. looked in the window. still no buffet. \\n\\nso if i could, i would give no stars because i was unable to even try it.  \\n\\njudge for yourself. firstly, the food was good.  however, i have absolutely no respect for restaurants that rip you off. be mindful of the prices on the menu when you order.  they like to charge you $2 more per entree.\\n\\nalso, the waitress was excruciatingly slow. there were only about two or three parties eating while we there and it took her 15-20 minutes to come and gather the check. family ate here tonight...had a deluxe 9\" pizza...had to have been store bought the nuked by this place...first time eating here...won\\'t again...i can say the salads and sandwiches are pretty good...don\\'t get the pizza... i used to love pizza hut.  it used to be my one and only pizza place, but ever since moving into this neighborhood, i\\'ve had nothing but terrible pizza, so i switched to papa johns (!).  the pizza ends up really thin and greasy; there\\'s really nothing to it.  what a waste.  plus, they don\\'t do the stuffed crust pizza promos that other pizza huts do...so, this place is just a lose-lose.  gross, awful, and expensive.  plus, the delivery drivers always call you before they\\'ve arrived, which means they\\'re expecting you to meet them at the door, and they\\'re not even there yet!  at least i don\\'t waste money on tips?\\n\\nafter four months of papa johns, i thought to myself, \"that pizza hut couldn\\'t have been that bad,\" so i tried it again.  someone tell me how to get this gross, greasy taste out of my mouth.\\n\\nin short, even if you like pizza hut, stay away.  this place is the worst pizza hut i\\'ve ever ordered from. went here last night with a friend and got food poisoning from the zucca pasta. informed the waitress after throwing up three times in the restaurant who said, oh sorry i hope you feel better. the only reason we informed her was so that she could make sure the kitchen knew and no one else got sick. very disappointed in the response that we received but i just wanted to go home by that point. disappointed in the hummus to the point it was not even appetizing to look at. please buy a blender that works. it was hard to choke down. pizza was burnt and small for the cost. not a fan. bland, expensive, overcooked.  this is the worst seafood i\\'ve had in the valley and with their prices, cuttlefish should have delivered amazing food.  the restaurant is beautiful but that\\'s about all that is good here.  the service was mediocre and the food couldn\\'t have been worse.  \\n\\ni\\'ve never had beautiful seafood so overcooked, under-seasoned and rubbery in my life and our entire table agreed that their dishes were terrible.  the spaghetti with prawns tasted like pasta, water and shrimp that were boiled for about 10 minutes too long.  this is nursing home food at best.  i left feeling hungry and robbed.  i doubt we\\'ll see this place sticking around for too long. if you\\'re looking for mediocre pasta dishes and minestrone soup featuring canned vegetables and thawed meatballs then you\\'ve found the right place.  on a number of occasions i\\'ve had decent italian food at their older location at scottsdale/carefree highway but at their new establishment the owners have hired cooking staff that serve substandard italian fare.  louie and his wife need to be sampling what\\'s cooking in their new kitchen.  for now, stick with their pizzas and salads. we checked out the yelp reviews before ordering for delivery tonight. although there were a few very bad reviews we decided to give it a shot. that was a mistake. \\n\\nwe waited an hour and a half for an order that was estimated to be delivered at 40-50 minutes. at already over an hour, we checked the tracker to find our food had been cooked for over an hour and had yet to be delivered. \\n\\nfinally we got our food and not only was the delivery driver was rude, our food was completely cold. \\n\\nwasted 30 dollars on cold mediocre pizza and terrible customer service. don\\'t order from this location. what a disappointment!!! got a groupon so we decided to give it a try. the menu on-line looked great. what was on the menu when we got there was totally different than the one on-line. $16.00 for a caesar salad made table side, was not made table side and was tiny. we weere told they were out of all the beef, steaks and veal chops that were on the menu. they also ran out of their specialty bread. we had to ask for butter 5 times. we had 1 veal marsala and one veal piccata that each came with a side of pasta. my husband\\'s pasta was ice cold. i asked for the vodka sauce which was an extra charge, fine but not for almost as much as a full order of penne a la vodka. that isn\\'t right. there was one table of 4 occupied when we came in, then two or three more tables of 2 came in while we were there. we were not offered the lamb that the other tables were offered. we waited 50 minutes to get our food. \\nmy husband just realized that they wanted to see the groupon before we ordered to show the owner to get the okay. we can only assume that is why we were told that the steak and veal chops were not available when other people got them. as it was, our bill was over $41.00 before tip, but after the groupon. without the groupon the bill was $80.00. alot for 2 people who had salad and veal scallopine. no liquor. i don\\'t mind paying for good food and good service, but this certainly was neither. this place is full of germs and got me sick. the restaurant is filthy and the manager needs to scrub the place and get a more sanitary system for serving food. i wash my hands before i eat every time, but think about how many dirty hands touch the pizza server handle. this is disgusting, you grab the handle and then go eat pizza with those hands. i wish i thought about this before they got me sick. do yourself a favor & use a napkin to hold the handle. better yet, get papa johns instead, it\\'s way better. i agree with joanne h. it\\'s no wonder every poor review has something extremely negative to say about maria. this place left such a bad impression that i felt compelled to share my experience. my partner and i walked in today and the hostess and servers all greeted us warmly, all except maria who was also standing there. the hostess asked us, where we would like to sit? she gave us several options to which i replied, \"the dining area\". the hostess proceeds to look at the seating chart along with maria who responds, \"seat them at table 10 for now.\" still not acknowledging us. i\\'m not sure what \"for now\" meant. ponder that one. we sit and our server named paleesa (i\\'m sorry for butchering your name dear) really politely served our table and was honestly the only positive experience we had in that entire restaurant. i ordered the parpadelle bolognese and my partner the chicken parmesan which were both good not great. the white and red sangrias were lovely. i\\'m from nyc where we know our italian food, this was ok. but the food was honestly not the worst experience. it wasn\\'t busy, there were four tables to be exact. maria seemed very approachable and friendly to every other table as she walked to and fro greeting and having conversations with all the guests, some which she was obviously familiar with. all the while just passing by our table as if we weren\\'t even there. even making a point to say hello and introduce herself to the lady sitting at a table about four feet away from us. although i prefer to not be bothered and enjoy the ambiance and evening with my partner, maria was obviously going out of her way to ignore us, something which was evident from the moment we walked through the door. could it be that we were 30 somethings, outsiders, i, a latin american and my partner an indian american? i don\\'t know, i personally don\\'t care. i too am a shop owner and every single customer is made to feel equal. i would be humbled and grateful that out of so many establishments you would choose to spend your hard earned money in my business. this here is not the case. it\\'s so easy to be pleasant and friendly to those you already know but the true test of character and heart is showing that same courtesy to the \"strangers\" who are also guests of your establishment. i think that\\'s how you keep them coming back, am i right? or maybe she\\'s just interested in her \"regulars\". however, she didn\\'t seem interested in our business. i\\'m a new yorker and i overheard her mention she lived in nyc. well we new yorkers are very tolerant, open minded, we love diversity and great food. and great food has a way of bringing people together. both which is failing in this restaurant. great food and bringing people together. so we pay our tab and start walking out of the door, maria starts to also walk out of the door and sees me leaving as well and instead of holding the door for me she lets it close behind her. this woman is rude. talk about going out of her way. as she sees us leave she still doesn\\'t even say a word to us. she proceeds to use her phone and walk back into the restaurant. my hats off to our server and the rest of the staff. i hope the owners know how lucky they are to have you. they were indeed a good example of how to treat a customer, something maria should try to model herself after. it\\'s good to be kind, it doesn\\'t cost anything. never coming back here again, good riddance. we ordered chicken marsala without mushrooms.  what was served was a chicken breast covered in brown gravy.  we also had the \"homemade lasagna\".  it had layers of gray pureed meat with ricatta cheese.  the noodles were tough and rubbery.  we also had beef ravioli which also had this pureed gray meat inside, served with the toughest unseasoned meatballs i have ever had.  the sauce was meh.  i looked around the restaurant and noticed that most everyone had pizzas or sandwiches.  i can understand why.  if you go there stick with that.  i am italian and it was an insult to try to eat those entrees (which we did not). don\\'t eat here. the service is excellent but the food was very average, not a good value. the best part was we couldn\\'t get a sangria or mai tai because their bar didn\\'t have the goods. c\\'mon mb! your charging me $32 a day fee, go to albertsons and buy supplies! ordered take out....wrong sandwich given to us and a hair in the ranch dressing!!! disgusting! would not recommend! you would think that being rhoded ranch there would be some kind of quality assurance....obviously not, yuck! almost everything was horrible that we ordered! the calamari was a joke. it went straight to the trash. the baklava and cheesecake were ok. we won\\'t be ordering again. went here for the lunch buffet. first bad sign: at 12:30, the place was half full, and yet none of the vacant tables were clean. yuck. second bad sign, passing by the salad bar, the lettuce bin was full of huge chunks of brown iceberg lettuce. gross. third bad sign, passing by the pasta buffet, the spaghetti was dry and crispy. eew. the pizzas are plentiful, about six varieties, and frequently refreshed, and, the buffet is cheap. however, the pizza crust is soggy. sweetie wanted to give a second star because of the frequent pizza refreshing, but it was just too gross for that. terrible!!!!!! wish i could give it 0 stars.  my cousin had the basement reserved for 2.5 hrs after her wedding (deposit paid).  we showed up late only to find that the place was closing down!!! the manager had sent all his staff home! what?!?!? who does that??? would not recommend this place to anyone just avoid this place if you don\\'t want to be disappointed. i gave this place 3 chances only because the first time i did like the pizza. since then they put no sauce on the pizza, nothing like eating dough and toppings. i decided to give it another try and ask for xtra sauce, still dry, i guess they didnt understand what i was saying, or i was thinking they didnt hear me. well today i gave  it one last try and i asked for xtra sauce and made sure she heard me, took pizza home and disgusting. no sauce very dry. my daughter said little caesars was better. i don\\'t get it, they are very cheap on sauce, i have never tasted a pizza so dry. i refuse to give them a 4 th chance. they lost my business. i have been twice with my family and both time service was ridiculously slow and the food was terrible.  never again not coming back here! girl on phone was rude, i was overcharged, they forgot my ranch and messed up my order and their wings tasted horrible! avoid at all costs! never again. ordered the greek salad and had to toss the entire thing in the trash. the didn\\'t use greek olives, they used black ones. huge difference and big mistake. it wasn\\'t a couple either, it was like they dumped an entire can of chopped up black olives on the salad. the dressing wasn\\'t even greek dressing, it was a dark balsamic that had the consistency of jello. i almost vomited. this was my first time coming here and it\\'s my last. don\\'t waste your money like i did. we have been to this location before and the pizza was great! this time it was 9pm on a saturday night, we walked in to find 6 ppl sitting at the bar and  one  bartender working.  all the tables were empty so we chose one that was  clearly visible from the bar.  we aren\\'t  gamblers and were only there for the pizza. we waited a couple minutes, the bartender never acknowledged us.  i then decided to keep my eye on him to see if he looked up or made any move to help us.  at one point he came out from the bar, i thought maybe to find a server or help us, no he went to the kitchen to retrieve food for someone at the bar.  no eye contact was ever made with us.  when another guy came in,clearly a regular, he was greeted with \"hi buddy\" immediately.   we waited a total of 10-12 minutes and no effort or eye contact was ever made to get us to move to the bar or order. i asked my husband \"move to the bar, or leave?\"  we left.  \\nit\\'s a shame that this place that has excellent pizza probably won\\'t make it because of no customer service. good luck! so staying at a casino hotel and these guys slip their ad under our door. i call and order and they tell me it will take an hr. ok whatever it\\'s a hotel but they were over 1hr & 40 mins late and had me waiting for the pizza in the lobby. i had to cancel and they didn\\'t get a crap. beware and just go somewhere else. ridiculous,  should be no stars as no food was prepared when i ordered for pick up. placed order online for 4 pizzas and several orders of wings. received confirmation email and pick up time and no notification that that we were \"supposed\"to call and confirm... \\n\\nshowed up at our designated time to pick up the order for our staff with of course nothing even started and was informed we were supposed to call and confirm by the older gentleman working there. \\n\\nhorrible customer service and respect for time.  would hate to see you call to make an appointment at ouroffice and then we cancel it because you didn\\'t call us again to confirm that you really did want your appointment you already scheduled. \\n\\nlittle caesars here we come. \\n\\njuan zero stars if i could!  please please please, someone open another kind of pizza place and not domino\\'s either!  i will say, that when they do get the pizza right, it\\'s pretty good but i have had soooo many problems with this place.  so far they have credited me with so much since they have messed up so often.  i really do not want the credits, i want the pizza right!  one time i ordered online for a later delivery because we were not home yet they showed up 30 minutes before we were home and then tried to come back and deliver the same pizza.  another time they got our order wrong and it took 90 minutes to get it right.  one time the delivery guy dropped my personal pan pizza on the ground while taking it out of the hot box and promised to get a new one out right away, it took over an hour (i live about a mile from the store).  sometimes they forget the receipt, which really freaks me out because i have no proof of purchase with all of their mistakes.  for the most part the toppings are skimpy and i\\'ve actually taken pictures of the pizzas because i could not believe they would deliver a pizza like that and then i ordered a pizza and used a coupon code that was sent to me and it said it wasn\\'t valid at this pizza hut.  why the heck are they sending me coupons that don\\'t work at the pizza hut i order from?\\n\\ni\\'m to the point of opening my own pizza place that delivers because this is just crazy!  the only reason i continue ordering is that when the pizza is finally right, my kids like it but trust me, they would like it better if the pizza was right every time as i think they are tired of hearing of me complain about pizza hut!!!! this place is food poisoning in the making. when you order a slice employees never wash their hands nor do they use gloves, and that\\'s all after taking your money and ringing up an order. if you order an artichoke dip expect it to be microwaved for couple minutes stirred with any tool available (finger, pens, thermometer) then microwaved again. i was surprised and disgusted with the level of sanitation in this place. eat at your own risk. night before thanksgiving and the family was feeling particularly hungry. we decided to opt for something new and picked magura as something quick and convenient only to be quickly disappointed. after looking at their entire menu, i placed an order and sat back to patiently wait. about 20 minutes later i get a call from an 800 number with a lady full of attitude complaining that i didn\\'t answer her first call, (it ran twice and hung up before i could answer) only to say they didn\\'t deliver as far as our location. disappointed i hung up and checked their yelp page/directions to realize i lived only 2.7 miles away. why offer delivery if you don\\'t even go 3 miles for your customers. after that and a rude phone call don\\'t think i\\'ll be trying my luck at magura any time soon. haven\\'t eaten here in a while. tonight, ordered like 4 pizzas and bread sticks for take out. \\n\\n\\nterrible!   undercooked.  greasy. \\n\\ni\\'ll never order from this location again. \\n\\nentire slices had grease dripping from underneath. \\n\\nbreadsticks still had garlic dripping. if i could give them a worse score i would, ordered delivery first time eating here. never again. pizza was worse than school cafeteria food, soggy crust, barely any toppings and just not good. i ate entire 12in minus a piece my wife ate, and i wasn\\'t full. then i went and got her chipotle . the menu said \"jumbo boneless wings\" 5 piece $4.99 they were chicken nuggets like you\\'d find in a frozen foods isle at market, smaller than mcdonalds nuggets. the drink, i finished it in about 7 sips, and had 3/4 cup of ice left over. the salad looks good i haven\\'t eaten it yet. i had to go get my wife something else to eat. the online app for ordering was confusing and difficult, cannot edit have to delete item and start over. no way to check on your order, delivery was over and hour and food was barely warm. i paid $34 and $5 tip for this! never again! went before a baseball game with the kids. limited menu. my husband asked the same server 3 times for a water, he never received. my reuben tasted like eating a salt stick. won\\'t go back! really disappointing.  the lobster roll was rubbery and soggy and just kinda gross altogether.  service was...new. this place is for people whose palate has yet to evolve beyond spaghetti-ohs.\\ndeli products are overpriced.\\nand the sandwiches are as disappointing as my effort in the bedroom. \\nnot really.\\n\\nyeah...really.\\n[sigh] total rip off $109 for two with no alcohol. rushed to order and rushed to leave. quality of food was average at best. limited menu offered on new year\\'s eve. when we made our reservations they did not tell use they would be offering a limited menu. broccoli rob was undercooked, portion of fish was very small. if i could give this place a negative star i would. our waiter accidentally spilled the drinks all over my cousins husband. his jacket got soaking wet. the manager just so happened to witness it all.  we got a half assed apology. not once did they offer to give him a dry anything. when it came time to pay my cousins husband and my boyfriend went to complain to the manager and he simply gave off the \"i already apologized what do you want me to do?\" such a dick and asked them to leave. obviously these people need to get their shit together. this place on eastern avenue was great.  but, unfortunately it is now shuttered and closed, with an \"available for lease\" sign hanging over it on my last visit two weeks ago.  several months ago a sign on the door said the restaurant was closed for remodeling.  apparently now it is closed for good. let me start by saying i have frequent ed this restaurant many times and food is very good. that said i was appalled at how we were treated tonight i have never been treated so rudely  from an establishment that takes my money and makes their living off of customer service. (and i\\'m originally from ny where i\\'ve experienced rude) apparently this establishment is closed on mondays. they were having a special event-however- no notification was posted. so we went in. ordered drinks- expecting happy hour pricing. served us/charged us full price and after we paid actually yelled \"get out\". could it have been handled better- absolutely. if we had politely been asked to leave or explained the situation- we would have left. if you are  considering this restaurant i would go to casa mia on 136th. you would think local restaurants would want to encourage local clientele. not maria this spot. maybe bad day, but to outright yell is unacceptable. i have been waiting for my delivery for over two hours now and still nothing. called the mangers number listed on their flyer that was left on my gate in a neighborhood that does not allow handbills/flyers. worst service i have had to deal with, will not be ordering from these people ever again. horrible customer service i will never eat here at this dirty olive garden again waitress was rude in unprofessional horrendous customer service. kristi was rude from the moment i walked in the door. i used to eat papa murphys weekly...after today i definitely will not be returning. do they answer the phone?! omg i was on hold forever... online kept telling me they dont deliver to apache/mc clintock but they have before. annoying.. service was lousy food was ok the lobster bisque was the best thing on the menu so i ordered a drink of southern comfort and ginger ale my drink of choice but they don\\'t serve that type of whiskey so i ordered a jameson and ginger ale it was ok but the drink was $7.50 i didn\\'t want gold i only wanted a drink , was very excited about getting the bolognese ragu pasta... most of the reviews were excellent. key word is \"most\". ubereats was incredibly fast as usual...... unpacking i was a little disappointed with the amount of pasta being a bit more than an appetizer.... no big deal, it\\'s the flavor of great italian food i was looking for....... at first bite i was severely disappointed. it was tasteless and devoid of flavor. felt like i was eating mushed up mcdonalds hamburger meat with some pasta around it. actually, mecd\\'s would\\'ve had more taste. never again. i posted a negative review of the pizza, wings, and drink, mistakenly under my wife\\'s account. the owner responded, no offer to make it right, just \"i\\'m sorry you didn\\'t like our food\" and the he proceeded to defend bad food, slow delivery, a cup of ice(that they called a drink). if your gonna get a bad review offer to make it right for the unhappy customer to try to retain there business, rather than make excuses and say the customer is wrong. i read other reviews as well, and any responses to the bad reviews  were the same, excuses, saying there was nothing wrong, saying how they\\'ve been in business for 30 years, blah blah blah. own it dude, your pizza sucks, your so called jumbo boneless wings that would satisfy a cat, and poor delivery time, and a cup 3/4 full of ice when finished, do not make for \"good food\"! and when i said i have had caffeteria pizza better, i mean it, my school pizza was better than this tasteless, soggy, no topping, cardboard pizza. i moved here from mi. and i have been looking for a \"good pizza\", so far pizza hut is the best i\\'ve found in charlotte. romanello\\'s is worse than domino\\'s, at least when i had an issue at dominos\\' they gave me my order remade another day for free, and a free item of my choice. so while they messed up initially, they made it right, that is why i will go back to domino\\'s, but never to romanello\\'s. my friend and i ate here months ago at lunchtime since he had a coupon. the food was good, but the service (even though there were only about 2 other tables in use) was exceptionally slow.\\nfigured i\\'d order some takeout from there tonight and avoid the service. i ordered online. first, the website told me they couldn\\'t deliver to me. i live just on the other side of the 60 on dobson. whatever. i change it to pick up. after placing my order, the website never told me when i could pick up my order. ok. i figured i\\'d give them about a half an hour.\\ni show up at the restaurant, and again there are less than 10 customers in the place. nothing is marked as a pick up area, so i stand there a few steps inside the door. the waitress comes by, says hi, then proceeds to ignore me. i moved closer to the bar, looking at her, but she won\\'t acknowledge my presence. after a few minutes, i give up and walk out. they didn\\'t even call to see why i never picked up my order.\\nthis place has the absolute worst service i\\'ve ever encountered. i would never recommend anyone go there unless you see it on one of the undercover restaurant shows first, as maybe they\\'ll get their act together then. stopped in for the lunch special. i was going to get two slices and a drink, but one slice looked sufficient, so i went with that. \\n\\nall the pizzas look like cheese pizza because the pepperoni and the sausage are buried miles below the cheese. you practically need a magnifying glass to see there\\'s pepperoni in it.\\n\\nhere\\'s where the story ends: one bite, and the cheese/pepperoni came off all at once like a wet blanket, leaving only the tomato-sauce covered crust remaining. um... okay.... so, buh-bye to that whole slice of pepperoni as i bought it and hello to a remaining piece of dough covered in tomato sauce.  yummy if i had a hangover and didn\\'t care. not so yummy if all i wanted was just a slice of pepperoni pizza. is it too much to expect that cheese and pepperoni to remain on that slice of pizza until, oh, i don\\'t know, i\\'m done eating it? shouldn\\'t some cheese and pepperoni remain on that slice for a second bite, and third bite, and a fourth bite, and a fifth bite, until i\\'m done eating it?\\n\\ntaste-wise? well, not sure how accurate my assessment would be as i had to chew it all up all at one so i didn\\'t spit it out and then re-eat it (because that would be gross.) but i did taste a lot of cheese. and i could tell there was some garlic in it. sorry i can\\'t describe the taste with any more accuracy than that. \\n\\npeter piper pizza is better than this. heck, even a frozen pizza is better than this.  if i ever return, i will be sure to bring a knife and fork to be sure i don\\'t lose that slice on the first bite. so i was craving wings n ordered a10piece well done light sauce and a ceaser salad. $17 delivery plus tip and 45-60 min delivery. fine. the guy showed up in 20min and the wings were under cooked  microwave bs i can\\'t believe it. i will never order from here again!!!! had to cook my wings in toaster oven for 20 min on 350. wtf. seriously. no chicken at kfc. seriously at 9pm on a weekday i pulled up to the drive-thru and was presented with a mumbling unintelligible female voice stating that they were, \"out of chicken, but if i wanted to wait 20 minutes they would make some more.\" i responded all chicken? your out of all chicken? to which she responded, \"yeah.\" wow, what an experience a kfc with no chicken. it took over two hours to get in and out with a small party. the server did not know what to do. bad service, but the food was good. we made a reservation here two weeks ahead for a saturday night at 9:30 pm and waited an hour once we got to the restaurant. the foyer was packed with people and they did absolutely nothing to accommodate us - did not even offer for us to start with drinks at the bar. the maître d avoided talking to us and did nothing to mediate the situation. after over an hour of waiting, he told us to leave. there were many parties in the same situation. would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. they are extremely poor at managing their restaurant as well as customer service. we did not receive a single apology and our saturday night was ruined. very turned off and disgusted. where to start, waited 45 minutes to be seated, although there were plenty of empty tables, five in our group, one ordered chicken sandwich, 3 ordered hamb, i ordered pizza after another hour cold food was delivered, but was informed they couldn\\'t make the pizza due to bad dough, did i want to order something else? might have 45 minutes ago, but at this point just wanted to go home, were entertained by a group of rowdy ten year olds playing corn ball, not a great sunday night, and no manager ever appeared to apologize, they did comp my tea ordered a buffalo chicken hoagie, worst chicken i\\'ve ever eaten in my entire life it was like the chicken been sitting out for months. also had a half of steak hoagie the steak was hard and looked like gyro meat the fries on the hoagies were so soggy and it was unbelievable. food went down hill incredibly me and my girlfriend couldn\\'t even finish over hoagies. not to mention how over priced it was. i\\'m very disappointed i spent $32 for us not even be able to eat will not be ordering from here ever again i went to mamas i found out that there is new owners the new owners changed all the recipes and the food stinks original owners to own the place made me feel like i was home in new york the food was incredible and now it\\'s not so you guys need to go back to school  learn how to cook worst restaurant experience this year.    the food is bland, frozen pizza crust,  barely edible.   the salmon sandwich was sickeningly sweet; who marinates salmon in sugar??   there is no rhyme or reason to entering this place and figuring out where you\\'re supposed to go and where you\\'re supposed to order.   i\\'m sure it would be fine for just a coffee or beer, but i highly discourage ordering food.    to make matters worse,  i asked the cashier how long my food would take when i ordered, she said 7-10 minutes- it took 30.  no apologies other than \"sorry we\\'re real behind.\"   \\ni am not outrageously picky,  but the three things we ordered were all unappealing. i like supporting local biz, but come on people. \\noh,  and coffee sucked.   the end. the restaurant is nice looking, but they ran out of all the foods we could eat on the menu and didn\\'t tell us they were out of food before we sat down. \\n\\nso we had to leave after we had already ordered wine and settled in to try to find another place to eat. they were nice about it but it would have been far better if they had been up front about their lack of food so we could have made better choices instead of ruining our evening. this place has really gone done hill and they make no apologies. i have ordered many a pizzas from here and service has been like a plane crashing. last few order have taken over 45 min to pick up from the time i ordered them. one time it took and hour and 11 min. no apologies and every time i asked about my order it was the same response just 5 minutes. it was five minutes 20 minutes ago.  come on.  you guys didn\\'t make my pizza yet. i\\'ve just moved on. good riddance. \\n\\nyour food was overpriced, overhyped and unremarkable.\\n\\nand your service was the absolute worse!!! this place is extremely unprofessional,me an my family was invited here,well my mother was invited here for her birthday an they did not accommodate as they said they would,are bill was way more then it should have been an just unprofessional when the situation was brought up i ordered and they took 30 minutes to say that they canceled my order due to a new location opening up near me. when i tried to call to resolve the issue, they ignored my call 3 times. i\\'ve ordered multiple locations at least 20 times and this is by far the worst  ever. i guess they cater to the college students (sarcasm). after making an order online, i found a hair baked into my slice of pizza! immediately, i became disgusted and ruined my whole families appetite and mines. i called and talked to the manager billy who was completely unprofessional and arrogant, he then demanded i bring back the pizza (we threw this pizza away) or else he couldn\\'t replace our order. after explaining that i threw this pizza away, his response was \"what are you trying to get something for free\"? i have a history with pizza hut and they can look up my number and i have never asked for a refund of any one of my orders, i am a hard working man who don\\'t need a $7.99 pizza for \"free\" all i wanted was to provide my family with dinner of their choice. after all the other options there is in laveen, we will be ordering barro\\'s next time and every time after! see my picture i attached to this pizza hut if you don\\'t believe me. the cashier was very rude and on mother\\'s day, wouldn\\'t let me order food while others already ate she preferred to ring them up first, even though i was in line prior to these customers. . . very poor customer service, i have never eaten at this restaurant and now never will, was so looking forward to my mother\\'s day meal from this place ooh well. ihop treated me much nicer by far the worst place i have eaten at i vegas. the food was microwaved, not fresh, and disgusting. this place is know for their artichokes. let me tell you that my 12 year old can make a better artichoke. i do not recommend eating here. i was excited to try this place out.  thanks to a newly acquired allergy, i\\'m living the gluten free life these days, and anywhere that caters to me and my fellow sufferers, is worth trying out.  \\n\\ni placed an order online for a friday night pick-up.  keep in mind, i don\\'t exactly live close, but was willing to make the drive.  my order was placed several hours before pick up, and consisted of one gluten free veggie pizza, and one traditional veggie pizza, for my niece.  \\n\\ni left a little early, to stop and do a little shopping along the way (why make a trip for only 1 purpose).  as i pulled into the parking lot, it was easy enough to spot, considering how tiny this place is.  i walked inside, checked out the modern decor, and waited for someone to appear.  as i identified myself, i could see things starting to look bleak.  the guy helping me out (who didn\\'t introduce himself, & didn\\'t have a name tag on) let me know that they were out of gluten free pizzas, but would be happy to make both my pizzas traditionally.  i can see this person doesn\\'t understand why people eat gluten free in the first place.  obviously i was confused, and probably starting to look displeased, and as i started to ask, \"what do you mean you\\'re out of gluten free pizzas?\", he interrupted me to let me know that they tried to call me and tell me.  strange...i didn\\'t hear my phone ring.  i took my phone out of my purse, and realized they called me 4 minutes before i was supposed to pick up my order.  now that\\'s just ridiculous.  they had to know i was already there, or almost there at that point.  now i\\'m just ticked.  first off, who runs out of gluten free?!  second, you obviously knew you were out, but didn\\'t call me until i got there?!  you had more than 2 hours to call and let me know.  wow.....now i\\'m just speechless...mostly because i\\'m hungry, and pissed, and afraid i might spontaneously combust at this point.  although this twit has no idea about customer service or food allergies, i doubt incurring my wrath will do more than scar him for life, plus my niece was there, and lord knows that child needs a good role model in her life, so i leave hungry, and disgusted.  \\n\\nif you\\'re going to make part of your business model selling specific items that cater to allergy prone people, maybe you should do a better job of educating your staff, and maybe you should do a better job ordering supplies/ingredients, and maybe, just maybe, you should all learn what good customer service entails, because i guarantee you that experience i had could not have been any worse.   if i could give you less than 1 star, i would. i am not to happy with this location, i ordered pizza thinking it would be delivered fresh.\\n\\nfirst thing was it took them nearly 2 hours to deliver and pizza hut sent me an email stating it was just going to be 45-60min. \\n   second, when the pizza was delivered it tasted like old pizza, as if it was sitting in the drivers car for awhile. \\n\\noverall, not just they\\'re service was terrible but the quality of pizza being made at this location isn\\'t acceptable to me. food was disgusting the only reason we went there was that we bought a restaurant s.com voucher where you save like 20.00 dollar s so we decided to try it and we ordered a salad , dozen wings , large pepperoni pizza . the lettuce was old the tomatoes where mushy , the wings tasted like they\\'ve been sitting for a while , and finally the pizza was flavor less nothing on the pizza stuck out . but that is not the worst part nasty food aside the staff decided to add themselves a 30% tip never going there again the worst bar experience i\\'ve ever had. bar tender was rude from the moment we sat down and it continued through out the service. such a bummer. the quality and freshness of the food is questionable.  i order the panini. one slice of the bread was served green and moldy.   they tried to blame it on the grill, but that makes no sense because only one of the slices was green.  the other side looked fine.  we waited for them to remake it.  when the server brought it out, she did not even apologize!   when we got the check, they did nothing to compensate for our experience.  we asked to speak to the manager.  she was defensive and also blamed it on the grill.  when we asked to have it removed from our check, she said she couldn\\'t because they remade it and because we ate it.  again, no apology or attempt to make our experience better.  they do not value the customer or take ownership of a problem.  very poor service and experience was disappointing.  the manager and staff need customer service training. breakfast, eggs benedict was the worst i\\'ve had. the three small potatoes on the side were clearly cooked before and warmed, old. the skin was crispy but potato cold. my boyfriend has had a sore stomach since then, friday morning. be warned. wish they would hire employees with reading skills....ordered online ...arrived to pick up only to find out they made breadsticks instead of the ordered cheesesticks...looked around the filthy prep area and decided i am better off to get my money back and run..... some of the worst service i have ever experienced.\\n\\n#1 called 3 times just to be put on hold and then hung up on. this was 15 min of waiting just to be hung up on. this is very typical for them.\\n\\n#2 was told 45 min - 1 hour for food. took 1:15\\n\\n#3 left out part of the order so had to call back to get the left out item delivered\\n\\n#4 it is currently over 1 hour later and still, no show with the rest of my order.\\n\\nso from my initial call at 5:46 pm, i still dont have a complete order and it is 8:15!\\n\\nhire a manger that can get their act together and give decent customer service. if you can\\'t handle delivery, stop offering a half-ass service\\n\\nwhy would they really care - they already have my money so there is no incentive to do the right thing - at all\\n\\ni am being absolutely fair here whoever said this rivals new york pizza must not have any taste buds! i\\'m actually from nyc and this place is worse than any place i\\'ve ever been to in new york. i went to this place when i was visiting montreal with friends and this place was down the block. i got 2 slices (one bacon and the other chicken). i ate the bacon one and was not able to finish it. it made me sick. if this is good for montreal pizza then i would suggest not to eat pizza in montreal or at least don\\'t compare it to new york. go to montreal for the poutine not the pizza. i would leave zero stars if i could. i ordered two mashed potato bowls in the drive through. the attendant asks me to park and he will bring me my food out. he hands me two drinks and i drive away to park and wait for my food. he comes out after 10 mins or so, and hands me a bag. i get to work and there is only one bowl in the bag. i called the restaurant and speak to keisona, that tells me she is in a lunch rush, and cannot help me. was charged for two bowls. no apology. no attempts to resolve. had to call their customer service to file a complaint. will never come to this location again. the worst experience i have had in my whole dinner life\\n\\ni ordered crab stuffed mushroom. that fake crab was very low quality that had really strange taste and they should have described as fake crab instead of crab. and i also ordered spicy seafood pasta.\\n\\nbecause, i like pasta, seafood and spicy. calamari was too dried i couldn\\'t eat and mussel got too much fish smell i was afraid to eat pasta because i can\\'t afford sickness.\\n\\ni decided not to eat and asked a check. surprisingly, they charge me the pasta clearly i home eat and didn\\'t want to take to home ordered takeaway which included calamari, baked ziti, cheesesteak with peppers and onions with a side order of fries. calamari for $13 tasted like frozen over cooked squid. the baked ziti which is pretty hard to screw up was beyond bland with not enough sauce and they used very cheap cheese because you can definitely taste the difference. the garlic bread that came with was horrible it didn\\'t have that fresh out of the oven taste. my hubby\\'s sub was very disappointing for him, it was very dry and the meat didn\\'t have the juices dripping down like should happen with a steak sandwich. now as for the fries which mind you are not included with sandwiches are right out of the frozen aisle at your local grocery store. my hubby said nasty babe try one, i told him he no way in h@ll will i eat one of those!! $40 later & beyond dissatisfied will never never ever be back & would never suggest the restaurant to anyone!! save your $$, you may have to drive out of the area for real italian dishes but you\\'ll be thankful that you did!! the salad plates were not chilled... as they usually are it however is a busy night but something\\'s are expected at the olive garden... the food tasted like it was under a hot lamp for so long it tasted almost hard and also under cooked for the seafood... not a great experience at the olive garden there are certain things expected... the expectations are not that high shouldnt be that hard to do.... when i looked this place up, i was expecting a restaurant separate somewhere downtown. turns out it\\'s inside a hotel near the slots. i ordered a vegan pizza that was too greasy. sad to say, i didn\\'t like it. :/ heads up, first 90 minute parking is free. when we moved to vegas two years ago, this was our go to place. over the last few months, the place has changed ownership and the quality has gone to shit! the only waitress worth anything is ellen, always has been. the new owner is an asshat! he was extremely rude and has absolutely zero business skills. sadly, the quality of the food has also declined. i don\\'t think we\\'ll ever be back again! rude people specially name m.c no customer service skills at all .. it took 2 hours to deliver my pizza & my soda & the delivery driver asking $5  tip so i gave him 5cents i told him share that  to youre co workers,.... average food combined with really poor service.  owner\\'s wife seated us, and sat across from our table conversing with friends.  ten minutes later, not even a glass of water while she was sitting directly across from us the entire time.  hope she enjoyed her chat.  epitome of arrogance. tried to call location for 15+ minutes straight to place a carry out order.  finally got through as i was less than 5 minutes away from location.  i informed justin, the manager, that i\\'ve been trying to call for over 15 minutes and he claims that he didn\\'t hear the phone ring.  i walk in and the only order on the carry out screen is the one i just called in.  very disappointing overall experience. i\\'ve ordered from here before and this always happens so here i am finally saying something about it! they said 30 mins and it has almost been an hour- why even say 30 mins. or call me and tell me. arrived at 6:15pm and told we had a 30 minute wait for a table. an hour and 22 minutes later we still don\\'t have a table.   sitting at bar to get food with an 8pm show at the oaks theatre. hostess was no help when asked about the situation.\\n\\nwould not recommend. get your act together. i\\'ve been to this establishment once before and i must say, it was quite enjoyable. so coming in for the second time i had high hopes. well to say the least it was an appalling dining experience. right when i was about to order my caesar salad i felt a somewhat stringy substance on my tongue. it turned out to be a large black hair. i immediately left the establishment and will never go back. fuck this place and fuck all the positive reviews only went one time. apparently there was only one server working, it wasn\\'t very busy though. was with a party of 8. it took over an hour to get the starters. when i received my spaghetti after nearly an hour & a half i was disappointed. the food wasn\\'t great at all, the whole party had similar feelings with their food as well. will never be back. \\n\\nonly thing the place has going for it is the manger. she was a very nice lady and very friendly. this is the worst papa johns establishment you could ever order from. they always have some kind of issue and cant their stuff straight. i even started doing carry out orders because there is always some kind of issue with delivery. if you think this will save you hassle i promise you that all you have is an even bigger headache. more then once when i did carry out they told me it was not ready and would let me know when it was done. seeing pizzas on the shelf i question in my mind if its mine extremely upset with the fact that i submitted an order, and 20 minutes later i get a call saying the order wasn\\'t submitted in time before closing? if these people don\\'t want to work they should shorten their business hours. 2 weeks & i haven\\'t received my refund. i ordered before the pizza is bad. but the wings and garlic fries are good! pizza is not good\\nsauce taste stale\\nrestaurant appears dirty\\nno restroom available for the customers \\n\"go to dotty\\'s, they will let you use theirs\"\\ndisregards for sanitation a very rude young lady just dishonored a coupon by saying that it was pickup only which was never stated on the coupon.  basically told me she didn\\'t want my business.  after being a loyal customer for years i\\'m done. i recently visited phoenix and stayed at the hilton hotel. after my work meeting went back to my room and decide to order food from this place. i had the shrimp fra diavolo and a side salad. the salad was plain no flavor and lacked dressing. the shrimp was over cooked and it\\'s tasted like rubber. the linguini tasted rancid, nothing special about the sauce. i literally could not continue on eating the rancid taste the linguini had. keep in mind this plate cost $27 and only included three shrimps. i could careless for the price, but at least focus on the taste. i will avoid this place at all cost when visiting phoenix. just horrible!!! after ordering two soups and a small cheese pizza and spending 35 dollars my order arrives and i get soup and an everything pizza ? i call and tell them they sent the wrong order they apologize and say they will send the correct order right now do after an hour i call and they say that the phone person that took my order left for the night and forgot to put the order in... then got a little nasty as i was up set them sent another pizza 30 minuteslater... 3 hrs for a pizza and the soup was very salty to the point that i wished i opened a can of soup ... go else we\\'re meh. i\\'ve experienced better its totally correct! however, if you live close by and want something to feed the family that is ok and relatively cheap, this a good place. it\\'\\'s very loud inside and the decor is very busy but nice. \\n\\nmy reason for one start is because three times now we have ordered to go food and it seems that our dish was sabotaged each time! twice came without chicken and all twice with the bread being super cold as taken out of a freezer recently. one time came swimming in sauce and it became disgusting to eat. \\n\\ni called the restaurant for one of the occasions. they didn\\'t act if it was important or a big deal. they refunded me only after i requested and it took over a day. i was told someone would call me back to follow up and i received no calls. \\n\\nif you are in business to serve people their meals, you should take a little extra precautions that the food is done correctly. i should not have to get home with hungry kids and have items missing. this should never happen twice or even a third time. \\n\\nit seems to me that this bucca di beppo is careless with the food they serve and how they treat their customers. the use of overpriced frozen foods is outrageous. i had tried the calamari and noticed right away that there was two types of it on the plate. one that looked dark and old and the other looked freshly cooked but more like it came from a frozen bag. after eating it, the texture was completely different between the two.  i couldn\\'t finish anything else. after diner though came the worse part as my wife and i were to watch a movie at the theater nearby but half way through the movie i felt sick and found myself throwing up. wife and i had to leave the movies early, we don\\'t get to go out often, but this was a horrible time cause by this restaurant. scary doors are filthy told the people that escort you to the tables that they were dirty and they told me they just cleaned them the black dirt on the door  has been there for a long time it\\'s  thick just look at him when you enter the restaurant both doors and the second set of doors if the doors in the front look like that imagine what it looks like in the kitchen beware !!!!!!! hostess told us the high tops in the bar were open seating. so we went in and sat down at a filthy table--but figured they just hadn\\'t had a chance to clean it yet. 10 minutes later some server walks up and says you guys just sit down? we say yes and he says well these tables are not open seating and we need to clean it up. we tell him the hostess said it was open and he says well there not. 10 minutes with no acknowledgement and then a rude welcome. see ya. so coincidentally, i decided to give this place another try after i wrote this review, and i can\\'t say that i will be back. i am changing my review from 3 stars to 1 just because of the ridiculousness that was my sandwich. i asked for no cheese, add avocado. simple right? apparently not because about 80 percent of the time i have asked for avocado (and it costs an extra 75 cents mind you) i haven\\'t received it. you think i would just learn and stop asking for it, but i tried again. this time they gave me cheese and no avocado. apparently this is the hardest thing this place has to do because they can never get it right. and this time they actually added something i specifically said not to. so eff you spicy pickle. i am breaking up with you.   5/1/11\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nworking in an office is sort of like searching through yelp. your coworkers bring in lunch from random lunch places you didn\\'t know existed, and then you file them away in your bookmark section of your brain to try later and review. spicy pickle is one of those places i had no idea existed. i moved to this area of town almost two years ago and i am still finding new places to try. its like a food expedition every time i go out. i had seen one of my coworkers bring in spicy pickle about four times before i decided to try it late last year. i have been here at least seven or eight times by now, but lately i just have not been that impressed.\\n\\nwhen i first came to spicy pickle i was excited about another sandwich place to try. you see, i love sandwiches. you give me two pieces of bread with any combination of dressings, mayos, and veggies in between them and i am one happy girl. i don\\'t know if the excitement got to me or what but for at least a month after i found this place i was in here every week at least. its right down the street from my work as well so that made it super convenient. i have only had the bastille sandwich, but of course i customize it to my tastes. i skip the cheese, sub sun dried tomato mayo for basil mayo, and add avocado. it was pretty tasty. but then i don\\'t know what happened. maybe i ate it so much i got sick of it, or maybe i just realized it was only a sub par sandwich, but i fell out of love with spicy pickle. every time my husband wants to come here now i make a face. maybe its because they added on a side with every sandwich as well as raising their prices. i\\'d rather have no side and less expensive sandwiches, thanks. \\n\\nbut! there is one thing i continue to love about spicy pickle, and you guessed it. its the pickles. they are so spicy and crunchy and i love that. i have a hard time finding a spicy pickle at the store that i like. maybe i need to learn to make my own. but anyways. it has been a few months now since i have been here and i haven\\'t had a craving to return. perhaps one day i will. but for now i will continue to think about their pickles and wish i could just buy them by the jarful. first time. last time.  ordered delivery because we were busy at work. all prices on their delivery flyer have changed. didn\\'t even offer to honor it. says free delivery - there is now a charge. took over an hour to receive 2 orders of chicken fingers and a sandwich less than 1/2 a mile away. fingers are overcooked and now rubbery.  meal came with a can of soda. we asked for coke (they didn\\'t have any) so we asked for 7up & sunkist. we got 2 7-up. as stated in the headline - first time, last time. i\\'ve been a regular enough patron at sambuca for a number of years. it\\'s been a great place to have a good meal. sadly, things have changed. my last visit i ordered a pizza from the daily special and asked for no onions. i was assured it wouldn\\'t be a problem. after a considerable wait i was served a pizza with onions on it. i told the waiter and he carried it off to the kitchen. to my dismay, he returned immediately and placed it on the table in front of me. i was told the chef said there were no onions. however, after he must have removed some, there were others still clearly visible. i was floored by the way i was treated. had to order something else. no serious apology... it will be the last time i visited the place. i completely understand this is a chinese buffet and can\\'t expect much.  however, even by these standards, this place performed poorly.  two major themes that lead to this 1-star rating are: little rotation of food and flavor.\\n\\nwe were here for 1.5 hours after a long day of work and wanted to relax and catch up.  pit time was prolonged because we were waiting for a number of items to be replenished.  two different pans sat empty for an hour.  we gave up waiting on those.  also, several items looked near empty and unappealing, yet they, too weren\\'t replenished.\\n\\nthe flavor across the board was either too salty or not seasoned enough.  the only items perfectly cooked were the steamed rice and egg rolls (the latter likely being factory made).\\n\\ni suggest you consider eating elsewhere. ordered take out from here, and it was absolute garbage. the pizza looked like it was slopped together and they skimped on the toppings. terrible attempt at neapolitan pizza. save the headache and check out queen margarita or pizza libretto instead. i was at cibo the other night and to be quite honest it was different from when i went  a few months ago .\\nthe food was wanna be italain but tastes more i don\\'t know.not italian....italian is easy ingredients and not a lot of them.\\nthe place was empty something must be going on.\\nwhat is this number thing on the menu.....oh by the way what style of pizza was it???i can get this type of dought at italian supermarket  ...oh and the dessert where to say to least pathetic... never, never should any one go there. the food may be good and the service attentive, but it all amounts to naught.\\n\\nthe sound level at lunch or dinner is so high that you cannot hear or even communicate with the wait staff without shouting at the top of your lungs.\\n\\nthe sound level is actually beyond the legal limit for workers in ontario. employees are only allowed to work a maximum of ~ 2 h/day in this 90 dba (average) environment)\\n\\nhttp://www.labour.gov.on.ca/english/hs/pubs/noise/gl_noise_appb.php\\n\\nto get value for your money, go somewhere else. i moved away and returned after a year.\\ni was very excited to eat at joe\\'s again.\\n\\ni got a take out salad on friday night. \\nwhen i arrived, the server hadn\\'t even ordered it.\\non the bright side, he admitted he forgot.\\nok, people make mistakes.\\n\\non saturday i ordered gluten free pasta with marinara and extra dressing for my salad since the takeout container they give you literally holds two teaspoons of dressing, not remotely enough to cover a salad.\\n\\nand the dressing changed. it barely has any flavor now.\\n\\ni also asked for extra sauce.\\n\\nwhen i got home, i had a container of 90% dry pasta, and 10% sauce so i had to walk back and get more.\\n\\nand i questioned why my $12 entree cost $13.85.\\n\\nthey charge you $.75 for the extra dressing container that contains two teaspoons of dressing.  i don\\'t care about the $.75, but with the profit off the pasta, you\\'d think they cold stop nickel and diming you elsewhere.\\n\\nnot to mention they have zero reaction to that they screwed up your order.  he offered me a refund with an attitude instead of an apology and asking how to be helpful. two of the three servers could be robots and do a better job. the tall guy is the only competent one there.\\n\\nand then the sauce wasn\\'t remotely what i remembered it to be.\\nit was uneventful.\\n\\ni\\'m done with you joe\\'s. i only gave them 1 star because it won\\'t let you give them no stars!!!\\n\\nmy wife and i went in and ordered 2 coffees, an egg sandwich, and  the waffle. after waiting 15 minutes for the coffee, which i will say was good, it was over 35 minutes until someone even the server asked us if we were still waiting on food.\\n\\nthe food never came out!!! when i went up to the manager he said he sent it out 7 or 8 minutes ago. he was full of it!!! no server any where in the place with food.\\n\\nwe will never to going back again and i suggest you avoid this place, even as a last resort!!!!!! very dissapointed. service was rarely offered. we got here at 6:30 and they were out of stuffed mushrooms. they ran out of take out boxes for the unflavored, bland chicken picatta. the rigatoni, while the portions were lots, it wasn\\'t anything to write home about. customer service on the phone was amazing but his is what we got. extremely disappointed and still very hungry. i really wanted to write a good review based on customer service. horrible, went there on a wednesday night when there was no one else but myself there and i ordered a personal pizza that was way over priced. they charged me for a 2 topping when i ordered a 1 topping, it took the guy 30 minutes to bring the tiny pizza. i said black olive only and they gave me black olive and pepperoni, when i told them i don\\'t eat meat they took it back and picked off the pepperoni and added extra cheese to hide it but the cheese was not melted and it still had the grease from the pepperoni.. oh and not to mention it took the guy another 30 minutes to do that to my pizza.. when i saw this i asked for my money back and walked out never to return, awful! great food + horrible service= never coming back! (deserves no stars but was unable to leave a review without a star nellos does not deserve for their service) currently going on two and a half hours of waiting for my delivery. we\\'ve called twice. each time it\\'s, \"oh it\\'s five minutes away!\" we live two minutes away from the place. not once have they apologized or offered to comp any part of the meal during either phone call. \\n\\nthe customer service is always terrible (except for the delivery driver - love him!) and the only reason we\\'ve dealt with it is because the food is so good. not bothering anymore.\\n\\n*update: at the three hour mark they call and ask if we still want our food. umm no! they never put a delivery ticket on it. fine - mistakes happen. but nobody noticed an order that didn\\'t move for three hours or bothered to check the finished orders either time we called?  \\n\\nnever once did they apologize. i ordered delivery tonight and got a 16\" one topping, alfredo pasta, a garden salad, and a 2 liter of soda. \\n\\nfirst the pasta was awful, there was no flavor.. at all. there was melted cheese on top and i couldn\\'t even taste that. alfredo is supposed to be creamy, yummy, and this was far from it. ive literally had better from the grocery stores freezer section. the pasta itself was mushy, really mushy. the garlic bread tasted like oil, no garlic taste at all, no butter-y goodness, just oily and tough (like chewing beef jerky)\\n\\nthe pizza was weird, like the crust was almost cardboard-y, the sauce had a strong sweet taste like they added to much sugar, its got a strong basil taste as well. the cheese had no flavor again, it was almost fake tasting. the sausage i got on it reminded me of ground beef thats how small the chunks were. \\n\\nthe salad was even odd. for one they put it in the same bag as the pasta which means it was warm, and sweated. the tomatoes were slices (how much energy does it take to chop a freaking tomato) and the cucumbers were soggy. lettuce as meh, but what got me is the ranch was gross. it tasted like a cole-slaw dressing mixed with ranch. sweet and mayonnaise-y with an odd powdered ranch taste. \\n\\nthe soda was good though, perhaps its because they didn\\'t make it. they took over an hour to deliver and they are less than a mile away. \\n\\nnow the driver was awesome, nice guy, even thanked me for the tip which shows great customer service . 15 dollars for two people food was not good salad was old pizza was cold pizza taste weird only thing good cinnamon rolls not worth ur money ok...so called this place at 6pm...just now got my flipping pizza!! its now 8:15!!! the pizza isn\\'t any thing that great either...crust boring...just very \\'ok\\' pizza..definitely not worth $21 & a 2 hr wait!! plus they forgot our side of ranch!! this review is in no means meant to put down all of the staff. amanda is the worst bartender i have ever seen in my life.  as a server she was terrible, as a bartender it\\'s even worse. i give this establishment so much of my money and the service is horrible. today i walked in with my wife and the bar was basically empty. i got multiple glances from the bar but no one would serve me.  the guy that bartends is very professional along with terry and tracy. i guess amanda doesn\\'t like money because she sure as heck won\\'t serve her customers. we just left and she didn\\'t even bother to try and stop us. this is the third time we have had to walk out like that. unbelievable. this place has the ambience of a starbucks.  it is overly bright, with a window looking into the men\\'s section at the bay.  we ordered a couple of cocktails to start- i had the bannock caesar.  it tasted as though it hadn\\'t been stirred-- really harsh vodka taste, and watery clamato finish.  the order of bannock/artisanal bread was strangely presented, with miscellaneous breads piled in a bowl *on top* of herbed butter.  we shared the macaroni & cheese and the shrimp/fish cakes.  both were bland and unimpressive.  the whole time i felt like i was eating at an airport or something: that kind of chain restaurant, overpriced, generic experience.  will not be back. i went to trattoria reggiano on the strength of its yelp reviews. how could so many people be wrong?\\n\\nfirst, the restaurant is located within the venetian hotel, which is like a maze inside. even a map is unhelpful and we had to constantly ask people where to go to find the place.\\n\\nwhen we walked in the waiter asked us are we ready for some \"real italian food.\" if his statement was right i never want to have it again. first we had spaghetti and meatballs, pasta with bolognese sauce and chicken francese. the bolognese sauce and chicken had no seasoning. literally the chicken tasted like absolutely nothing not even a hefty dose of salt and pepper could save those two dishes. the spaghetti sauce tasted like it came out of a can. on top of that almost everything is in the $20 range. there are so many better italian restaurants in vegas than this place.\\n\\nthis was our last meal in the city before we went home. what a way to go out on a bad note. horrible. rude service, little to no options for vegetarians, overpriced for portion size. rock hard flavorless tomatoes, etc. my egg salad had shells in it. when i complained they looked at me like there was nothing wrong, no offer of a refund/replacement, just a shrug and \"oh\". would not return, i always give restaurants a 2nd chance because mistakes do happen, but their complete lack of caring has resulted in a lost customer for life, they do not deserve a chance to redeem themselves. a group of us tried this place out because of the good reviews, but 3 out of 4 of us were extremely disappointed by the service and food. we told our server we had a show and he still moved slow as molasas. the only good thing we had were the fire roasted olives. we expected more out of this place based on reviews and especially the price. brucshetta was medeocre and the pasta was not good at all. lazy, and relies way too much on carbs. food and drinks are overpriced and when one menu item is a sandwich filled with spaghetti and meatballs this place is just another example of parma trash. how can someone give 3 or 4 stars for a pizza buffet that has the lowest quality possible ?      goes to show....people will rave about anything they can stuff there face with........i want to open a pizza place that will do such as that.......ha ha ha  i just might do so...and that place will be called..........b......nvm\\n\\nmsc i am not to happy with this location, i ordered pizza thinking it would be delivered fresh.\\n\\nfirst thing was it took them nearly 2 hours to deliver and pizza hut sent me an email stating it was just going to be 45-60min. \\n   second, when the pizza was delivered it tasted like old pizza, as if it was sitting in the drivers car for awhile. \\n\\noverall, not just they\\'re service was terrible but the quality of pizza being made at this location isn\\'t acceptable to me. \\n\\n\\n\\n8/5/2016 1:40pm\\ntried giving them another shot and hopefully getting better customer service. unfortunately nothing has changed ordered my food 11:57am i get the confirmation stating it will be delivered at 12:55 pm. i called the place at 1:00pm confirming if it was made and delivered, guy tells me they were waiting on driver. i call back at 1:30pm a lady with a rude attitude answers and i tell her the situation and told me the driver didn\\'t have my unit number and my phone number was listed wrong on the order. they tell me they have to put in the order again and remake it. i figured through my name and me ordering there my information such as my email, previous number from last orders would be posted.  i\\'m just hungry and haven\\'t gotten any good customer service if i am able to give zero stars i would.  \\n\\n first of all the management and delivery staff are rude!  the delivery guy sat in from of my office for 10 minutes with our food in his car before he came into our door.  \\n\\nsecondly, we ordered \"sandwich\\'s.\"  their definition of a sandwich and mine are completely different.  when it came it was a calzone not a sandwich. they should really tell people that their sandwichs are actually calzones.  i do not eat calzones. \\n\\nwhen i called to complain the manager was rude and raised his voice.  he asked me why his delivery guy was doing in his car for 10 minutes.  i said it looked like he may have been on his phone but i don\\'t know because i was not in his car with him.  the manager then responded with a wise remark.  the manager also decided he was done speaking with me and hung up on me!!!!  this place is very unprofessional and really needs an attitude adjustment.  \\n\\none of the ladies decided to at least try and eat what was delivered.  it is greasy and inedible.  it is nothing but dough.\\n\\ni will never order from them again and recommend you don\\'t either. people always make fun of the olive garden, and i never understood why. but guess what? now i get it! the other night i brushed my teeth for about a half hour and headed over to olive garden for dinner. i took one bite and suddenly all the olive garden jokes made sense to me. everything at this place tastes like toothpaste. it\\'s crazy!!! neverending breadsticks? yeah that\\'s great if you like toothpaste bread. ugh, and the pasta? that stuff tastes just like toothpaste. it feels so good to finally understand why everybody\\'s always making fun of this place. talked to some friends about it the other night. \"hey guys i went to olive garden for the first time.\" i told em. they all laughed and said things like \"ewwwwww\" \"gross!\" and \"don\\'t even get me started!\" i chuckled and said \"i know right? if i wanted to eat toothpaste i\\'d just eat a tube of toothpaste!\" they said \"huh?\" one star for this place. what happened? i remember coming to this place for the first time and it was filled to the brim. food was excellent and service was spectacular. a highlight being the fried chicken skins. well...not so much this time round. a very clear indication of our not-so-good time was an almost empty restaurant, odd seeing how it was a friday night. the food was bland. their current menu, lackluster. they removed a lot of great dishes, like the ham hock, and replaced them with \"i could get this anywhere else\" dishes. service was awful. the server was arguing with another co-worker. they ran through their supply of soda for the night, which we were comped for, the server ran through and poured what was left into our cups, letting us know all the while (we were not offered something else to drink). our food came out at odd times and we were left alone, no check ups on refills or a \"how is the food?.\"  we had ordered some other drinks when our server happen to walk our way....actually glad she forgot someof our order, considering how everything tasted. hah, nothing could redeem okra that night, not even the chicken skins. poor excuse for pizza. ordered 2 toppings which were tossed on & pizza slice not re-heated. pizza was \"dry\".  service was prompt. first time ordering pizza i ordered the 2 pizzas and 2 liter soda. the order took almost an hour. \\nthen they said they have sprite instead of 7up as i was paying i said i will take the sprite.he pointed to the cooler and said it\\'s over there. i guess that means i\\'m getting it. then they expect a tip. not even a thank you. no customer service skills what so ever very poor customer service. when i ordered online and my pizza didn\\'t come, i called them and they told us that sometimes their websites don\\'t process orders completely, and it would take them another 45 minutes to make the pizza. then it took them an additional 40 minutes to deliver the pizza, even though i live only 5-10 minutes away driving time (i don\\'t own a car otherwise i would have eaten elsewhere). when i went to pick up pizza, the driver\\'s friends were in the car with him - why?!\\n\\ndo not order from them. this is the kind of place you go at 2 in the morning when nothing else is open and it is the last option for food. fellini\\'s seems to specialize in serving over-sized portions of mediocre pasta swimming in grease. as if this weren\\'t enough, the also charge a price per meal as if this were some sort of amazing authentic cuisine, rather than box pasta in a small lake of butter. the deserts were passable, but nothing to write home about.\\n\\nas for the service, my partner and i were relatively impressed until we got our bill. when ordering our pasta, the waiter asked if we would like soup or salad. i responded, \"oh, i didn\\'t realize that was included. what are the salad options.\" the waiter responded caesar or garden greens and we went from there. the bill arrives after desert and it turns out we have been charged $17.00 for two salads. when i spoke to the waiter about this he told me that all of the menu items are a la carte. when i responded that he had failed to mention this when i had indicated it was my understanding the salads were included as a side with the pasta, he insisted this was my error and did nothing to rectify the situation. \\n\\noverall we had a mediocre dining experience coupled with absolutely unforgivable customer service. we will never be eating at fellini\\'s again, and recommending that our friends and family avoid this place when visiting las vegas. not impressed.  \\n\\ni haven\\'t ever had a truly amazing experience at an east side mario\\'s but this was particularly bad.  it was a quiet monday night and our guests wanted to go to a reliable chain restaurant, this being their suggestion, so out we headed.  \\n\\non arrival we were greeted by teenagers in very slopped very wrinkled white shirts and handed menus - with four inserts apiece.  it was a very awkward greeting as we fumbled with menus towards our booth.  \\n\\nmy guy and i usually enjoy their sizzling calamari al diavolo appetizer and we enthusiastically ordered it again only this time the calamari was soggy and lifeless.  as the waitress put down the little cast iron skillet, another staff member was shouting at her about something or other and she was yelling back across the restaurant (which certainly wasn\\'t packed).  not 45 seconds after our appetizer was served our mains followed.  i cannot describe how irritating i find that.  i realize that food should be served quickly, but i hate being barraged by plates and generally feeling rushed.\\n\\nmy main was a chicken alfredo dish which was rather tasteless.  the sauce was under seasoned and the noodles claggy.  \\n\\ni won\\'t be returning any time soon. ordered 5 items for delivery on a saturday night.  they never gave me an eta. after 75 minutes the delivery finally arrived. i had ordered fries with my guyro for an extra dollar but when i opened the box there were no fries (though i did get charged for them). i called them in hopes of getting credited for the screw up but they asked me to hold and forgot about me. i called again a short time later and they claimed to have no record of my order.  after a few more minutes spelling my name repeatedly and more hold time, i was finally informed that the manager would need to speak to me, but he was making the food that night and would have to call me back when they were less busy. he never called back.\\n\\non top of all this, my wife\\'s bacon cheeseburger was cold and made with bacon bits.\\n\\navoid!!!! worst pizza ever  & i eat a lot of pizza\\n\\nstaff was nice and very accommodating but the food was awful.  don\\'t know what they do with their itlaian sausage but it wasn\\'t chunks, it wasn\\'t crumbled it was kind of thin sliced and torn into little pieces.  the pizza seemed wet on the edges.  i took that to be because the did not drain their mushrooms or vegies before putting them on top or maybe it was not cooked long enough.  \\nhand leftovers  decided not to eat them. *amendment*\\n\\nok i am amending my review due to the fact that i\\'ve now been in cleveland almost 3 years and our experience with ocp has gone completely downhill. the pizza is still \"ok\" but over time has gotten greasier and greasier. i think the fact that they put the \\'za on wax paper, which doesn\\'t absorb anything, causes the grease puddle - however, i\\'m not claiming to be a scientist. \\n\\nthe reason for the 1 star rating is as follows: someone who works at ocp gave out our personal contact information to a delivery driver. my boyfriend started receiving text messages from the pizza delivery driver on a social level on nights that we had not ordered a  pizza. creepy as shit, right? right. needless to say we haven\\'t ordered pizza from there again... (shudders).\\n\\n++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nmy boyfriend and i just moved from chicago and have really become accustomed to thin crust pizzas. actually i\\'d consider myself a pizza snob, so the task of finding a new pizza joint in my area seemed rather daunting. i was told to try ohio city pizzeria, so i figured we should start setting them up and knocking them down as quickly as possible. \\n\\nthe woman on the phone was extremely nice. when i asked if they made \\'thin crust pizzas\\' she said she could make it as thin as possible, which was fine by me. i ordered my pizza and it was delivered to our apt in tremont in 45 min. everything went smoothly and the pizza was really good. \\n\\ni\\'d also like to add that they have green olives as a topping option and apparently that isn\\'t a standard topping in cleveland, so they get brownie points for that as well. \\n\\ni can\\'t speak to the actual establishment because i\\'ve only had delivery. \\n\\nwe\\'ve been in cleveland for 1 month and have ordered pizza from ocp 2x already. i\\'m definitely going call them again. lets just say ill be writing corporate. the worst customer service and attitude. never turn away a customer. and show respect . will never visit again. at first we split the caesar salad and cheese sticks. both were good but after that it went downhill. my ravioli arrived at room temperature.. if that.. i\\'m not one to usually send food back but i\\'ve never received food that cold so i did. when they brought back the pasta  i noticed that one of the raviolis did not even have cheese not the middle! i was frustrated since i already sent back the food once. my third ravioli had something hard (plastic?) in it! i was so disgusted that i couldn\\'t eat anything else. my boyfriend said his meal was just eh as well, def not worth the price. the server was very nice though and comped my pasta as well as a desert and took a discount off the rest of the food. i\\'ve been in az for 11yrs by way of nj. \\nso when i happened on this place i fell in love. the best ny style pizza i have tasted since being back home. mmmmm and their hot wings with fresh garlic, as i love them, to die for! don\\'t forget to add a big pitcher of cold frosty beer! now you got yourself a friday or saturday night meal!!! the pizza & wings are my fave, so much, i have never tried anything else. so yes, i would have to say this place has the best pizza ever! (been eating here for years)\\nbut wait there\\'s more!!!!\\ni will never ever ever eat there again!\\ni would rather buy a pie from walmart & pop it in the oven at home! and the wings, i throw down myself at home, hot, lemon pepper, teriyaki, spicy garlic.....whatever flavor i can make that right at home!  \\nwhy? i thought you\\'d never ask.\\nas my family & myself dined one evening on a pie, wings & beer, just as we were finishing up our meal my daughter looks to the side towards the back of the store and there the owner is sitting at a table picking his nose feverishly, mind you there\\'s a bathroom right behind him if he needed to go and clean his nose, therefore wash hands when returning to work. as a customer enters the shop and stands at the counter waiting to place an order he gets up and goes right behind the counter and serves this customer food, never ever stopping to wash his hands!!!! \\nit\\'s times like this i wish i was an undercover food inspector!!! \\nnow if you have read any of my other reviews you can tell i am a bit of a germaphobe. and this little stunt  and booger the owner has pulled, has lost a customer in me and my family forever!!!\\nthis review gets one star because i cannot give it anything less and like i said their food is the best so if you do not mind a little boogering in your food, then go for it! strolling up to the door, the first thing that caught my eye on a saturday night was an empty parking lot.  the lot was empty for a reason!!!  food was terrible!!!!!!!! service was worse!!!!!  owner was more concerned about his gaudy sports car parked in front of the door than he was with his customers.  do yourself a favor and even if the meal is free don\\'t go!  you\\'ll be stopping at in and out after you leave.  come on.....what type of italian joint reheats pasta????  dont go!!!! went in on a friday night to pick up food and a 12 pack, no complaints about the food it was great, but the female bar tending at the time was one of the rudest and sour type of person i\\'ve met in my life. the date was 9/9 if any manager reads this it would be in their best interest to reconsider allowing that woman to tend a bar. i have spent thousands of dollars at this place but every time i go they have several tables available and tell me that i have to wait for a table. unless you have a 5 carat ring on they won\\'t seat you. total discrimination. very sad. i decided to take some new friends out for a special meal and it was supposed to be an enjoyable time out with them and their kids. i made reservations for 4 pm for a party of 8. i intentionally made the reservation for 4 in order to avoid the large crowd that would be arriving from 5 onward. all of us arrived a few minutes before 4 pm. despite the fact that the entire room was empty where we would be seated, we had to stand in the waiting area for 20 minutes before we were seated. we ordered 2 fried zucchini appetizers. after they arrived, we noticed that no spoons were brought to use for the sauce. since the waiter never came back, and the zucchini would have gotten cold if we had waited, we had to tip pour the sauce from the bowl onto our zucchini, which made a huge mess. we ordered our food next. finally, when the waiter came back, we asked for bread, which we should not have had to ask for, since it comes with the meals. the bread came (one little basket that did not contain enough for eight people). we asked for butter with the bread three times. the waiter actually had the nerve to get an attitude and was very unfriendly. finally, a manager came out with a plate of butter 45 minutes after we asked for it. the bread was gone at this point and therefore we had no need for the butter. our friend had to ask for balsamic vinegar three times as well. it was absolutely ridiculous. we finally got to order our food. it took two hours for our food to arrive. imagine 2 kids (ages 8 and 10) sitting for two hours waiting for food. none of us ordered anything other than simple pasta dishes - plus the 2 kids ordered from the kids menu. we watched a family of 5, who arrived after us, receive and consume their entire meal before ours even arrived and another family came and took their place and were finished eating when we were! it was absolutely outrageous. when the food finally did arrive it was not as ordered. i ordered a salad with dressing on the side and no olives. the salad came drenched with dressing and had olives. my friend ordered a salad as well. hers came with no dressing whatsoever - not even any on the side - despite the fact that she did not ask for it this way. my friend ordered coffee to come with the desert and the coffee never came. she told the waiter to forget about the coffee because we were done with dessert. while we were packing our food up, a waitress came to our table with an entire plate of food that we did not order and tried leaving it with us. when the bill came it had numerous mistakes. first of all, the coffee was still on there. we were charged for two salads that we did not order. we were also charged for an entire meal that we did not purchase and my husband was charged extra for substituting chicken for sausage in one of the pasta dishes - although the waiter said there would be no upcharge and this was a valid substitution. we sent the bill back and everything was corrected except the coffee was still on the bill. it was unreal. so we had to wait even longer to get the bill corrected once again. we were at this restaurant for over 3 hours. we came at 4 and did not get out until a little after 7. we should not have had to be in this restaurant for more than 1 hour 45 minutes tops. it was an absolute fiasco and it was a very stressful dining experience.  i would not recommend this restaurant. we got the pasta with red sauce and lemon chicken. just awful! it taste like the sauce was straight from a can of crushed tomatoes and the chicken was just doused in lemon juice and nothing else. no flavor and super plain. the staff were ok though. will not be back.  tried this place at least 10 times and almost always had some sort of issue.  tonight was the capper.  \\n\\nhad to wait for third choice of beer because they were out of the first two. still got charged for beers we never received.  not a huge deal until the food came out cold.  overpriced cold crappy sandwich that was supposed to be hot.  served with cold french fries.  \\n\\nasked them to put on the penguins game on at least one tv and the response was \"we are having issues with the controllers \"????  we had the same response a few weeks ago.  \\n\\nwait staff always congregates together to talk rather than pay attention to the tables.  this has been the case ever since we began going there.  \\n\\nmanagement doesn\\'t care or some of these basic issues would have been resolved a long time ago.  \\n\\nwe are done giving chances.  we will not be back. they suck order online and they don\\'t even get the order right 39$ for 2 medium sized pizza\\'s when ordering 2 large pizzas.. i could have gotten better pizza from manh***en pizza or nap*** pizza.\\n\\nedit: they call a 14\" pizza a large save your money its a ripoff! the food was horrible, the lettuce wilted, the eggplant was not edible. it was such a disappointment as so many people have given it 4 stars. and the parking is unbelievable i have no idea how this place has a 4 star rating.  i had breakfast here with my husband on a saturday morning.  we both ordered the house breakfast, his no onions, mine no mushrooms.  the gentleman who served us our food set down a plate in front of me and told me there were no mushrooms even though there were clearly mushrooms on top and scrambled within the omelet.  i sent back the omelet and it took more than 10 minutes for them to serve me a new one.  both omelets were huge and overcooked, the toasted sliced baguette tough and chewy, and the hashbrowns were lukewarm at best with a strange citrus flavor.  everything was sadly underwhelming.  the only redeeming quality was the friendly manager on duty who stopped by to chat with us.  unfortunately, we won\\'t be dining here again. this place sucks bad. i\\'d rather eat pizza patron. and that pizza sucks ass. nasty ass skinny pizza. no flavor what\\'s so ever. rather eat dog food. this place will last not even 1 more year. horrible attentiveness: \\na 2 year local to las vegas, i brought two of my visiting friends who wanted to dine off the strip on a saturday night at the end of may. the restaurant was busy for any good joint on a weekend night. \\n\\ni arrived and waited about a minute for the hostess after we entered. a couple arrives behind our group, the hostess comes up, walks past me and greets the people behind us when we are clearly next in line.\\n\\nwe eventually get seated at the back patio after getting drinks at the bar, the weather was nice and i was looking forward to having a good time with friends i haven\\'t seen in a while. \\n\\nwe were seated for a couple minutes and someone drops off waters to our table and tells us our server will be with us, soon. several employees walk by our table numerous times and we are never ever greeted again...for about 15 minutes...while the staff is serving other tables, they even served a table that was seated several minutes after we sat down. i grew very agitated at the absurdity in the lack of service.  at this point, i concluded that our time at esther\\'s will be downhill from here. i called it a night at esther\\'s, we got up and walked out...with no one ever once greeting us again. \\n\\nwe went over to spend our time and money at carson kitchen to have dinner where service was a million times more better and the food was amazing. \\n\\ni am greatly disappointed i did not get to try esther\\'s kitchen, i had been looking forward to dining here since it opened. i am a great supporter of local restaurants but this experience left a bad taste in my mouth. will i go back? i doubt it, would not want to waste my time or spend my money at a place that gave me horrible service. horrible customer service the guy that took my order didn\\'t d\\nhave a apt number he knew i lived in a apt but never looked or asked for one so i assumed he has my full address .pizzas never showed up they called a cell number that was not working and never asked at the time of the order for a call back number. i called the store because the pizza never came instead of a sorry we will get it right out..they kid said we can cancel the order.. no i want the order but stated the drive went back to the store a mile away lol. i called the driver his phone didn\\'t work.. nope never again!\\n\\nrude and can\\'t figure out how to take a order horrible service, horrible food. went there with my family twice. first time was bad, so i thought maybe it was an off night. went back a few weeks later, nope, it\\'s just bad. bland food, almost like it was out of a box. this location has the worst customer service i have ever experienced. pizza hut needs to retrain every single person at this location. you will end up waiting hours for your pizza and when you try and call to check on your order you will be put on hold for over 15-25 min. this place is beyond ridiculous. i\\'m livid with my 2 experiences with this place. i\\'ve been to multiple locations and never had such a bad experience. it was lunch and this was the slowest i\\'ve ever seen an oregano\\'s.\\nwe came in for lunch on my boyfriend\\'s birthday. they got my order wrong and my boyfriend\\'s big beef sandwich was absolutely inedible. it was so greasy, i tried to drain it off but it just soaked through the napkin. it was so greasy you could squeeze it and grease poured out of it. i tried to get our servers attention more than once to alert her of our issues, but she never came around. finally, we were so hungry that we had to split my sandwich i didn\\'t order. i overheard our server comp the table behind us a pizza cookie who were also celebrating a birthday. we ended up paying for a whole meal we didn\\'t eat. i will never come back to this location. the staff here don\\'t use gloves to prepare the food here! i would be cautious bringing your children here to eat we will not be coming back here.\\nwhen i asked the staff as to why they were not using gloves they said that they didn\\'t have to wear them. when i spoke to the manager theresa she also said they didn\\'t have to use gloves only moving from one place to another but i clearly saw a staff eating food in the back then going back to cutting pizza with no gloves. the staff were rude and laughing when i brought this to there attention i will be contacting someone higher up! the last 2 pizzas i got were burnt they tasted bad won\\'t be going back the barmaid is not a pizza maker came here today at 1:40pm and we\\'re seated quickly.  that was 5 stars. from there it went south. no server yet and it is 2:03pm. had to go to the bar to grab a beer. finished said beer and still no service. i guess this is a place where you bring your own food and enjoy the ac. the ac by the way is good. can\\'t speak for the service or food. it\\'s now been 20 minutes and still no service. i\\'m out of here! had a very distasteful experience that made me remember why i dont go here.\\n\\nended up here on a sunday because zizi closed early and boy did we regret it. \\n\\nspaghetti was overly salty, both the filet mingon and new york steak were undercooked\\n\\nby the end of the meal i told my dad \\'at least your birthday wont be on a sunday again for a while so we won\\'t get stuck here\\'\\n\\ni am not going back this place was terrible. i had chicken marsala that was underdone and when telling my server she didn\\'t seem very concerned. i patiently was able to track down a manager who also didn\\'t seem to think that cold, undercooked chicken was of issue. i am really easy going if you can make me feel like you are trying... but they didn\\'t even do that, bastards. normally this place was ok. but we went there recently and the service and food were both disgusting.  \\n\\nour server was an asian guy who told us the calamari was only \"pretty good\" but better than the muscles. \\n\\nthat was the vibe to start our night: a server who didn\\'t even like the food. so we ordered with that great attitude as our starting point.\\n\\nwe got snails, calamari, and the cannelloni.\\n\\nsnails were good.\\n\\ncalamari was rubbery.\\n\\ncannelloni (after waiting very long time and offered more bread to compensate) tasted microwaved, rubbery. \\n\\nthe server then got mad at us for complaining, saying that him and the staff tasted the food and it was fine.  (btw, we never usually complain.. takes a lot for us to complain).   \\n\\nwhen he brought the bill, he said that next time he would charge us for food we return.\\n\\nthere won\\'t be a next time. pizza tastes and looks just like little caesars except it is $17 more.  we kept giving this place a chance because my wife loves the pasta but everything tastes like garbage.  i\\'ve ordered the philly, the roast beef and meatball subs and of which were subpar. so i figured i\\'d try the pizza, after all it should be new york style and how could they screw that up? well they did and now i\\'m officially done. my buddy & i went here for the last 2 sundays to watch da bears. the ventura grill has a terrific patio & a decent beer selection & pretty good food. what it is sorely lacking in is service. i\\'m talking epically poor service. we sat there for 15 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us. over 45 minutes for a hot dog & fries? and if you want a refill on your drink, you\\'d better order it when your current one is only half empty. so what is it? understaffed? poor planning? all i know is i gave them 2 chances & they blew it with me. i ordered online for a delivery order, i\\'m very disappointed actually. it took over half an hour just for the food to cook. i called the business to check on my order and as soon as i called he told me the delivery guy had just left. i waited 40-45 minutes for a takeout order!!! how freaking ridiculous. and the food wasn\\'t very good either. i got the broccoli cheddar soup, it has absolutely no taste at all. i also ordered chicken wings, medium spice. i was very excited to eat these until i opened the box. there was literally no sauce on it. i also wanted blue cheese but they gave me ranch instead. the fries were soggy and cold, too. definitely will be my first and last time eating this place. i would love to know what my $35 order of pizza tasted like but the driver was rude about the fact that he didn\\'t have enough change. he spent 15 minutes arguing with me to discuss what policy was on the bill that i had instead of calling back to papa johns like i asked him at least 4 times, then he asked for the pizza back without handing me my money. i didn\\'t get to eat here. i was in from out of town,  had had a really long day and thought i\\'d drop in for evening dinner after sauntering through the 4th street restaurant area and surveying the menus of the other establishments. shockingly, the hostess was visibly annoyed that i didn\\'t have a reservation and she grudgingly offered me a seat at the bar or a table \" downstairs.\" the stench from her bad attitude was repulsive. i further add that there were other customers and staff in the area so it was a bit embarrassing to boot. she made me feel as though i had done something wrong. i left the establishment  with a bad taste in my mouth which did not come from the food - which i had looked forward to eating based upon the number of positive yelp reviews. i have ordered from here before for delivery without an issue. last night i ordered for my family on yelp and waited over and hour with no sign of the delivery . the estimate said it was about an hour so i waited to call the restaurant. when i did call the guy you answered made me repeat the address and my order over 5 times before telling me he never got our order! i had a conformation number and email . i\\'ll never be ordering from here again. terrible experience. i never post reviews, usually because nothing is ever that great or that bad but i feel i owe it to other consumers to report this. rosati\\'s messes up my order, fries instead of the salad i ordered, no \"special \" hot giardinera for my sandwich, wife\\'s burger had no condiments although she ordered 3 and it was all cold. delivery took 90 minutes when it was \" confirmed \" for 45. restaurant can\\'t help me because their system is down and can\\'t refund my money because i ordered through eat24 . eat24 won\\'t even respond to my inquiry. bottom line avoid rosati\\'s and eat24 at all costs. buyer beware ! i have been getting pizza here for years.\\nfor a very long time i got the same order.the price kept going up and up, but since we liked there food we paid it. so recently to save some money we changed our order from a large to a medium pizza. our previous bill was about 41.00. doing this dropped our bill to about 32.00 it then went to 34.oo dollars and last week and this week it went to 39.00. my opinion. ... they will do what ever it takes to get there hand in you pocket.  when i asked why it went up 5.00 they told me it was the delivery fee, when i said i paid 34.00 last week with a delivery fee are you charging me 2 delivery fees... they changed it and said it was for the chicken nuggets.  well before we got 7-9 nuggets they said we can only get 6 or 12.\\nwe ordered 12 . so 5 dollars for 3 nuggets. you lost us, our money and our respect.\\ni don\\'t and won\\'t recommend you to anyone anymore worst.\\njukebox.\\never.\\n\\nlike being stuck in an elevator for 2 hours.  i don\\'t know if it was on auto-play or there were just a bunch of folks with terrible middle aged music syndrome, but even my folks have better taste (and they\\'re 60-something).  you\\'ve got to have some sort of filter on this to guarantee decent tunes.  this is crucial to any bar, c\\'mon! try to eat here last night since it got good reviews. just letting you know the place is closed. they are expanding! seriously bummed with our dinner last night!  the kitchen completely missed the mark!  where to start... i guess with the positives... the service was great!  the poutine amazing! so onto the negative:  the warm caprese... no flavor and the toast points were gummy,  artichokes not cooked long enough, meatballs eh, the bruchetta.. again on gummy bread.  salmon-simply off tasting, its sides seriously needing seasoning and we\\'re cold!  scallops also lukewarm, eggplant parm, while impressive looking- burnt! couldn\\'t eat.  the chicken on my salad also burnt!  the pastas were flavorless!  walked out with a 450 bill and felt robbed!!! my friend was hosting her birthday party at the restaurant and i admit it, it was a pretty big group (around 20 of us). i understand that we\\'re not your business or your baller status clientele but the way they treated us absolutely terrible; it was one of the worst dining experience i have ever had.\\n\\nfirst off, the food. i ordered the chitarra which was okay but definitely not the best especially for the price. while my sister ordered the steak which was very dry. this would\\'ve have been a two/three stars rating. however, the service was a huge disappointment especially coming in with such a high expectation.\\n\\nfor a higher priced restaurant, i was expecting a service that lived up to what i have heard about o&b. firstly, the first server did not let us order when we wanted to as it was easier for the server to wait until everyone came to the party (when we notify them a couple of members will be late and we will order first), all of us were starving at that point. strike one.\\n\\nstrike two was when my friend\\'s sibling arrived a little later than expected, so the sibling sits beside my friend while everyone else kindly shifted a seat down. but then is proceeded to be told that if she does, it will mess up the system and our orders will be pushed back half an hour. at this point we only ordered beverages and we did not understand why. \\n\\nwhen we were wrapping our dinner and paying the bills, the second server proceeds to make a comment of \"you guys moved around hence the paying process will take around 25 mins\" in a very rude tone. this was an unnecessary comment to make and was the final strike.  \\n\\noverall, it was a disappointing dining experience especially simple things that could have been done to alleviate the situation. i would not recommend this place and definitely will not be returning. pizza was below average. our order was incorrect. it took another hour to get our missing items. nothing spectacular about this place. won\\'t be coming back. if i could give this place a zero rating i would! i was so hot walking around and wanted something good to eat and my family owns two pizza places so i love trying new pizza and the lady at the front was so rude. seemed annoyed was not helpful. i asked if there was any special and she literally shook her head and didn\\'t even look at me. way to help out people, specially tourists wanting to have a good experience. didn\\'t even order anything because of her attitude i went on a saturday. first off the buser sat us down on a table that was dirty. there were crumbs on the seat and table with the bill from previous customers on the table. then it took forever for the food and drinks to come and they were not even busy. lastly, we order  an appetizer( 3 sampler one)that was either very old or over fried which i never experienced at any olive garden. this is my first time at this olive garden i have been to many others that have provided good service and food. i will not return to this location for the listed reasons above. bread for the sandwiches taste terrible, the pizza is awful, service sucks. if you see this place keep driving as a matter of fact try not to even look at it. it just ruins my appetite every time i do. just got sofia pizza i was just wondering if they change the recipe the pizza just doesn\\'t taste good anymore it was one of my best pizza in town but now it just taste awful how is it that a manager has blue hair? to what i know most food companies don\\'t allowed that kind of stuff, (pink, blue, green) those kinds of colors. besides the fact that their customer service is horrible! not looking forward to coming back to this place! yelp says bites and brews has closed, which isn\\'t exactly true... it\\'s still there, in the same location.  however, everything decent about it has changed.   they used to serve excellent pizza, sandwiches, and salads with create-your-own pencil and paper-style menus.  crumpled and dirty menus with a few sandwich options and tacos have replaced it.  our waitress told us that they haven\\'t been serving pizza for five months.  \\n\\nwe had chicken quesadilla to start, which contained canned chicken (or something that they dredged in water?).  even though we explained that we were going to share, we didn\\'t receive plates or napkins.  the gross quesadilla was followed by tacos that were even worse.  the \"fried chicken\" taco was a chicken finger cut in half on a flour tortilla, with a ranch and mayo sauce.  the pulled pork taco (recommended by the waitress) was completely inedible.  it tasted like it had been saturated in root beer and vinegar.  it was also covered in a mayo-based \"sauce.\"  \\n\\nbesides the disgusting food, the beer was slightly flat and didn\\'t taste normal.  i definitely won\\'t be back.  too bad this place changed... \\n\\ngo to harris grill instead if you\\'re on ellsworth.  it\\'s overpriced for the food quality, but at least it tastes good. looked at the yelp rating and was excited to try this restaurant with my kids.  however, when we arrived the host asked if we had a reservation.  we politely said,\"no\".  \\n\\nshe said, \"we have no table\" and didn\\'t even offer if we want to wait for one.  they just turn us away.\\n\\ni checked open table later and almost all time slots were available tonight.  i sincerely believe we were discriminated against and warn others to think twice before coming here. ordered a large pizza. paid for it. was told that the pizza would be ready in 15 minutes. 20 minutes later i was told that the person forgot to punch in the order. forgot!!! there was no explanation. i was given a dipping sauce as apology. i ve never seen such appalling service anywhere over canada. doesn\\'t deserve even the 1 star.\\n\\nhow the hell do you forget!??? that\\'s what you do for a job for gods sake!! horrible....we had the pizza, both regular and sicilian,, steak sandwich and the ravioli. i\\'m from the border of pa & nj , i know good pizza and steak sandwiches. this place isn\\'t as good as a bad jersey pizza place or a bad real philly steak.\\n     not again for me.. quite possibly the worst customer service i\\'ve ever witnessed.  never make the mistake from ordering from here. took a pizza risk and decided to try this place despite poor reviews regarding service. can\\'t really say much about the pizza since we were never seated. after waiting for nearly 10 minutes without a server even looking at us, we patiently waited a little longer before we gave up. there are many pizza places in town so we decided to take our business elsewhere. worst place ever! horrible customer service. the pizza took over 2 hours to get to our hotel and it was cold the mozzarella sticks were gross. never again. think before ordering from this place. worst service ever! sat at 6:30, ignored for 20 mins, ordered food and never arrived...we had to leave for a show at 7:45. very friendly staff. a little expensive for a meal. idk if the pizza is as expensive but my fettuccine alfredo with chicken with a combo was $18! i thought okay this has to be amazing if it\\'s this expensive. wrong. i open my meal to see that my pasta looks like soup. i stirred it and let it sit for a few mins in hopes it would thicken but i was wrong. i took a few bites and threw it away. highly upset that i could have made a better fettuccine alfredo at home. the only reason i would go back is to try the pizza...maybe. my friend and i came in for a late lunch around 2:30pm and we were greeted and seated quickly, since there was nobody here. i ordered the calamari and my friend ordered the iceberg salad. our food came out surprisingly fast, not in a good way, basically as fast as a fast food restaurant would bring out your order. the iceberg salad was drowned in dressing and the lettuce was limp and lifeless. it tasted like it was premixed and was sitting in the refrigerator overnight, disgusting. the calamari was alright. the last time i came here when the place first opened it was delicious, downgraded quite a bit. although we got seated quickly and our food came out quickly, after that the waitress barely even came to our table to check up on us. we sat here for an extra hour waiting for our check. definitely will not be coming back, would rather check out olive garden. before a pirates game we stopped in to get a bite. i ordered a hamburger with fries for $13.00. very disappointed. it took over 30 minutes to get the order. the meat was very dry and falling apart but not over cooked. this tells me that they added \"filler\", usually bread, to stretch the meat and pump profits. i\\'ve had juicier meat and larger patty at wendy\\'s for a sixth of the price. overall...i would not go back to atria\\'s. incompetent management:\\nwe\\'re from san diego, so fully immersed in the craft brew scene. this brewery, as seems by other reviews on yelp, has management issues & that was evident in our visit. \\n\\nfirst, we arrived early on a sunday eve & there was a 45-minute wait - although there were many empty tables (strike 1) - lack of planning on behalf of the management. \\n\\nso we sat at the bar & were handed menus by who someone washing glasses who we assumed was a bartender or barback. he informs us they were out of their stout (ok this happens at breweries sometimes) i was in the mood for a dark beer since it had been a cold, rainy day. then he tells us they are out of their porter and also out of their brown - so no dark beers on tap at all! (strike 2 for that - generous, should be 2 strikes, :)) at a brewery, how do you run out of all your dark beers at once? lack of planning & good management. so the only other dark beer they had was bottled, 12-ounce, from an unknown to me source. i don\\'t go to a brewery, especially to a disneylandish brewery, & put up with over-priced, underwhelming food, to drink bottled beer, but alas, had i any other choice? so i ordered the beer - 12 ounces of bottled beer poured in a 16-ounce glass - so it looked 1/4 empty - & the taste was bleh. i asked the bartender if i was stuck w/ it or if it could be replaced (seeing they had nothing dark on tap i could taste prior to ordering) she was great & said \"no problem.\"\\n\\nnext thing the other \\'bartender\\' comes to me, shoves a menu in front of me, points to the small print & says, \"says here we can\\'t reimburse for bottled or canned beers.\" i said \"the other bartender already said it was ok.\" he said, \"i\\'m the manager\" so no reimburse or replacement. i asked, \"even if you\\'re completely out of dark beers on tap?\" he said nothing i can do & walked away. (strike 3)\\n\\ni understand rules & policies. but the brusque way in which he said it & completely failing to offer anything else to make the experience better, even, what, a $1 off of an appetizer, anything would have shown an effort - it just seemed he just didn\\'t care about the customer, but more about saving a buck and adherence to his rules. \\n\\nwe closed out the tab & left. maybe i expected too much, but a reasonable selection at a brewery and/or a good attitude & willingness to make right on things gone wrong can go a long way for a successful restaurant/pub/brewery. \\n\\nthankfully, we\\'re back in san diego where our selection of amazing breweries is almost limitless...sorry for those of you living on the nw side of phoenix...we feel for ya when this is the best you have in the area. having been going to \"the brew\" since it opened.. food is great.. location is good..\\n\\nproblem is that it is loved to death.. needs a face lift.. it\\'s kinda of like that favorite pair of jeans you just hate to trash.. but not ready to accept reality. \\n\\nway to many folks here.. and expect to wait at least 35 to 1:15 min especially during friday to monday during the winter season.\\n\\nalso, forget trying to call in for take out... all you get is a busy signal or get hung up, on as the staff is working as hard as they can.. \\n\\nneed a larger place, more staff and a much better take out system.\\n\\n4 stars for food.. 3 stars for service, 1 star for take out and minus 2 stars for size and overcrowding..\\n\\nsorry.. just have to say it like it is.... i used yelp to order lunch. allowed for the time given for pickup. drove ten minutes to pickup and when i got to restaurant i was asked \"what order \". the woman found my order on her fax machine and said \"oh, i didn\\'t see that \". it will be another 15 minutes for us to make now. hello!!! i am on lunch from work. that is why i used yelp! the lady didn\\'t offer anything for my troubles. went through burger king drive through and ten minutes late on lunch getting back. milano\\' calls yelp and tells them i cancelled order. what??!! yelp calls me. i explain what happened and they said they would email a gift certificate. that was last wednesday. didn\\'t receive anything. very disappointed with entire experience not good pizza. ordered a large cheese pizza and a house salad. pizza was hardly large, no flavor, rubbery crust, hard cheese and sauce was bland. literally it was like gas station pizza or something, little ceasars is better, and that not saying much. house salad was literally only lettuce and a little chopped tomato, ranch was def like kraft or something not homemade and disgusting. will never order again. even my 9 year old complained and said it wasn\\'t any good. on the flip side, ordered through postmates and it was on time. well i just have to say that i will never order pizza or wings from this place. my sister ordered 2 pizzas and 50 wings from this place and had it delivered. first it took over an hour to get there only to be given some wings that had already been eaten with the bones still in the box! when she called to talk to the manager their excuse was \"the cook was eating and we probably boxed and delivered his wings\". excuse me but why in the heck is the cook eating where the food is being prepared!!! serious sanitation violation. do not go here if you want some pizza and a cup of water. they charge you for a cup of water. i couldn\\'t believe how rude their staff was. i had to have my male friend ask for napkins because the women didn\\'t even acknowledge me. most sexist place i\\'ve ever visited. i don\\'t even know why i keep visiting the most worst places on yelp. do not ever visit this place. unless you speak spanish, the associates only tended to the people who spoke spanish. unless you were a man, then the helped you. i will be spreading the word on not to come here. i would not even give 1 star. what a sh%& show. italian? what a joke. this place is a joke. all olive gardens are a joke. for some stupid reason i gave it a chance for lunch. mistake. soup is basically oil. the pasta is crap and nothing has taste. dazzling cafe lacks anything resembling dazzle, and potentially anything resembling an actual cafe.\\n\\ncame in with a party of four for dessert and were seated upstairs in a quiet little area with a handful of other tables. after a few minutes looking at the menu filled with expensive drink choices and an appallingly small number of choices for dessert, i settled on ordering a royal earl grey milk tea, and the rest of my party ordered drinks and a single pasta dish.\\n\\ni\\'m not sure why it took as long as it did to make the four drinks we had ordered, but two of the drinks were completely wrong (entered incorrectly by the server) and took another 20-25 minutes to appear correctly.\\n\\nin addition, we were charged for the incorrect drinks and the correctly ordered drinks after that, but after a bit of cajoling, the staff finally gave us the correct bill with a 10% discount for our troubles. that was the one nice part of the night.\\n\\nthe food was forgettable, the drinks were average at best (at not average prices), the decor was borderline ridiculous, and the service was bad all around.\\n\\nfrankly, this place doesn\\'t live up to its name, and the only dazzle i had experienced was in just how much worse they were than my low expectations.\\n\\ndon\\'t come here, go elsewhere for better food and drinks. went to fc using pogo pass. was told they don\\'t accept after 5 pm on fridays.  they claimed they had no control over the rule, although they are clearly the beneficiaries of such a policy. nowhere on their website is this limitation. they\\'ve lost us as a customer forever. they could have easily recouped any \"loss\" of 5 mini golf passes, by any money we would have spent on food, games, etc. bad management decision regardless of whose fault they claim it is.\\n\\nupdate: they contacted me saying they wanted to fix things. gave them my contact info, weeks have gone by and still haven\\'t heard anything. the service is awful.  went in on a saturday night around 7:30pm. there were about 3 other tables. took a few minutes just to be seated because no hostess was to be found. service started out ok, but once our food was delivered by the runner - that was the end of our interaction with anyone. server stopped by for a quick second to check on us, which at this point i was planning on ordering food to go, but i didn\\'t even get to answer before she continued on her way. then we sat for almost 40 minutes after we finished our meal for our check!! yes, a large party came in however, we were finished with our meal for about 10 minutes when they arrived. i couldn\\'t take the ignoring from all staff members any longer and was about to walk out when she finally came with the check. \"sorry this was unexpected\" was all i got. \\nthe food was decent. a bit overpriced. horrendous service. nothing to go back to that\\'s for sure. very unhappy with happy\\'s. my son loves their pizza, and that is the only reason i put up with them. it always takes at least one hour for food to be delivered. twice it took them 1 1/2 hours, and when we got the food, it was cold... duh. three other times the pizza we ordered arrived with toppings that we did not ask for or want. really happy\\'s? hire some more delivery drivers if this seems to be an ongoing issue with lots of people. service is not just for tourists who eat your food once. locals need decens places. btw- food, when it does come , is average. not worth all of the hassle there were 4 of us adults and 2 children (a 4 yr old and a 16 month old toddler) and we got charged gratuity!!! the website said gratuity is charged for a party of 6 guess they counted the children as 2 people. the food was mediocre and not worth the prices charged for the dishes. our server was grumpy and rude and refused to let me charge my phone in an absolutely empty restaurant. we asked her if she could add chicken to the pesto base pizza and she absolutely refused therefore customer service was a joke. i would not recommend anyone going there. if you\\'re looking for good italian food then jamie\\'s italian and scaddabush at square one are much better options that have excellent food with much better prices and customer service to match. pizza cold all toppings fell of and salad came with a breadstick bowl. not a good take out place horrible- will never return. i spent a whole season here playing volleyball, spent a generous amount of money there on a weekly basis. when we returned for a friday night out, the owner (yes the owner!) was behind the bar and charged us $18 for a beer- we tried kindly refuting the charge, kindly requesting to review the bar tabs in case there was a misunderstanding- she threw the pen at us and told us to bring cash next time. we are honest, respectful, upstanding neighbors, and were treated like trash and basically robbed. we will never return, and will spread the word. can\\'t deliver 5min away from it, still have the arrogance to send promotion.\\n\\nils ont le culot d\\'envoyer des promotions à mon appartement, alors qu\\'ils ne peuvent même pas desservir mon adresse.\\n\\n____________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n20:52\\n\\njean-philippe\\ncan i atleast know why the restaurant on masson street can\\'t deliver to my address?\\npizza pizza\\nthank you for following up. we are very sorry however it looks like the address is out of the stores area.\\njean-philippe\\nit\\'s 5min away from the restaurant it\\'s a piss poor excuse\\npizza pizza\\nwe understand and apologize.\\nwe will forward your feedback and concerns to the appropriate department to ensure this is addressed further.\\nseen by pizza pizza at 21:15\\njean-philippe\\nand i feel sorry that you have that kind of bullshit job. come on! \\n\\nmaybe i\\'m not getting what yelp is about. is it supposed to be an \"experience\" rating or something? or are you supposed to (attempt to) objectively evaluate the quality of the food we\\'re reviewing? cause this food is shit. i ordered it a few times when i first moved here and never again. i\\'ve had the pepperoni sheet pizza at a local bar and i\\'ll only eat it cause it\\'s sunday night and i\\'ve probably been partying. \\n\\ndoesn\\'t free pizza usually taste the best? not when it\\'s from ocp. \\n\\nsuper salty or they put tons of onion powder in the sauce, i don\\'t know what it is but it makes my stomach hurt, badly. two pieces of this stuff has prematurely ended my evening more than once, i vow not to do it to myself anymore, even if its free. \\n\\ni continue to lament the lack of an even passable pizza place that\\'s actually in ohio city. there are a few delivery options that are decent, but no real pizza joint. \\n\\nthere are a lot of urban hipsters on here who think that just cause you\\'re independent, you deserve a higher rating. just try to focus on the food. do you understand that just blindly \"supporting local business\" often means that you\\'re perpetuating mediocrity? please stay away from this location!!! i love papa johns so much i keep coming back, but it never fails i get the worse customer service. if i could give it no stars i would considering 2/3 of the times i order pizza i never receive it whether it\\'s ordered online or over the phone. then when i call them back they act like i never placed an order. 2162242312 couldn\\'t deliver a pizza or leave a voice mail guess they just lost a regular customer because they can\\'t deliver if i could give this place negative stars i would. the food was absolutely terrible. i got one slice in and decided i\\'d have to go somewhere else for dinner. when i told the waitress, she asked the manager what could be done and gave us a small discount. i was not about to pay for two uneaten pizzas. i asked to speak to the manager myself and i am absolutely appalled at how i was treated.  she told me that she would not comp my pizza because we had eaten some of the food, to which i replied that of course we had to try the food to know that it was bad. she said that if we had eaten the majority of our food then we would have to pay for it. i about lost my mind at this comment. there was one slice missing from the pizza. a single slice was gone from a six-slice pizza and she referred to it as the \"majority.\" when i finally made it clear that we should not and would not pay for such bad food and service, she rolled her eyes and scoffed \"ok\" at me and quickly walked away. this is without a doubt the worst customer service i have ever experienced. i will never be returning and i highly encourage that none of you try this restaurant. la bocca and mellow mushroom are both pizzas places just a few blocks away and are superior in every sense of the word. super disappointed.  pizza was bland and tasteless.  beer labeled as shock top was not that.  worker was rude and pretty short with customers. i left a review the last time on skimpy cheese compared to other locations. they managed to top it this time with almost none. i\\'m never going back to this location. stay far away. very nice inside service was ok. i got the baked cod,  the vegetables were good and the salad was good as well.   however when i took a bite of the fish.... well the first thing i tasted was the large amount of lemon and then it hit me.  the damn fish was spoiled.  i informed the bartender that was helping me and she took it back to the kitchen, when she returned she asked if i would like something else?  i said no thank you and asked for the check.  while i was waiting for the check the manager came out and mentioned that he\" took a bite of my fish and it did not seem that bad\"  i told him to enjoy but i was going to pass.  third bad experience at this location.  pretty sure i will not be returning. if i could give negative stars i absolutely would this is the last straw with hungry howies. i called to order a few calzones or as they call them subs and a salad i told him my address and he said was it in mesa i said no it\\'s in queen creek he took my order and said 35-40 minutes okay fine..i waited the appropriate time and gave him a call he goes \"your order was cancelled because it was too far\" i said oh they said my address was ok so i spoke to the manager who is the rudest and very argumentative mind you he was the one who took my original order and said the address was okay! he said we called you three times and it says something about magic jacks??? i even called you on my personal phone which sounds like a work violation but okay. so finally i ask him to read the number back and it\\'s absolutely correct and he goes well i already apologized. i have spent thousands here whether that be school events or work but i am completely finished. stay away at all costs!    what an absolute joke! how this place could call themselves manhattan pizza is beyond me. to even attempt to associate themselves with the pizza capital is false advertising. i would expect the pizza chains to play the size game, but not someplace named after ny. show me a place in ny where they have a 16\" pizza quoted as a \"large\" for $12.99? after a short argument with the owner he offered to make  me another 16\" for $10.00. really? $3 dollars in material and 10 minutes for $22? you should be ashamed! my original thought was he could have made a happy customer had he either cooked the size pizza i wanted originally, or offered me another for free. but when i got home and tasted this crap i realized that would have been a waste. this was hands down the worst pizza i have ever had ever! i could have bought a frozen pizza for half the price and been more satisfied. seriously, you can get a better pizza at chuck e cheese! after wading through clouds of cigarette smoke from their cooks/drivers standing out front and waiting for 15 minutes in the tacky dining room for my order that i called in an hour beforehand, finally got our pizza. over all the taste was ok but def not worth the price. there\\'s a million better pizza joints in cleveland- dont waste your time/money here. not really sure what they do here, but apparently it isn\\'t make or deliver pizza!\\n\\ntwice in a row i have ordered and then waited hours for a delivery that simply never arrives. when i call a manager isn\\'t available and my pizza is \"out for delivery.\"\\n\\nthis sucks. spoke to doug the gm last time this happened and he was apologetic and committed to it not happening again. epic fail. \\n\\norder from pizza hut. they show up.\\n\\n---\\n\\nupdate - 2.5 hours since ordering and still nothing. literally second time in a row. \\n\\nchristina is rude. she and the manager both get on the phone and claim nothing is their fault. what a joke!!!\\n\\nmatin is a moron (manager). said, \"i\\'m quitting this fucking job!\" \\n\\nthen hung up on me. \\n\\nwhat an experience. and still no pizza! wtf?! we\\'ve waited well over an hour 1/2 for two medium pizzas that claimed to be in transit over an hour ago. hopefully my food isn\\'t cold when it gets here... if it ever does. like what in the f. should\\'ve listened to past yelpers, jesus christ went for brunch and it started well. \\nordered the eggs benny with their \"east coast crab\" and was quite excited to try my fave breaky in a new way. \\n\\nlow and behold it arrives with imitation crab. i asked the server who insisted again, its real crab. so i asked her to inquire with the chef, who apparently said the crab has simply been vacuum sealed. \\n\\ni was quite offended -- you can not pass fake crab as real crab, ever. you should never lie to your patrons. imitation crab has a different texture, consistency, make up, colour (fake has the red colouring) and taste (fake is sweeter).\\n\\nim never going there again. worst meal ever..not chicago and not italian. \\n\\nlet me preface this by saying i am not an overly picky eater. and this was the first time in my life i was angry about the poor quality of the food i received. \\n\\ni brought my dad here for his birthday and thought it would be nice to go somewhere off the beaten path. being from chicago and italian we were looking forward to a nice meal. what we got was unacceptable on every level. \\n\\nit started with the poor welcome we received at the door and continued the rest of the night. taking our order the waiter did not ask what kind of salad dressing we wanted until we asked what the options were, and the same happened with sides of pasta that accompanied the main dishes (saying, oh well if you don\\'t specify you get what they decide to give you). \\n\\nthe bread was more suited to be a croissant than italian bread. then the salad came, one of which, one had the wrong dressing, strange because all four of us ordered the same (italian). \\n\\nthe food arrived shortly after, we ordered veal marsala, chicken parmesan, and meat lasagna. the veal was shaved veal? similar to roast beef, dry and overcooked....it was so bad i didn\\'t even eat it (and $32.95 for this??). the side dish pasta with meat sauce that came with it was just as bad; overcooked and sauce that tasted like ground beef with sweet ketchup. the lasagna was pasta, ricotta, with crusted beef on top, dry, no red sauce, it was terrible. the chicken parmesan was the only dish that was possibly edible but smothering it in that terrible sauce ruined any chance of that.\\n\\ni voiced my complaint to the waiter and asked to speak to the manager. neither the manager nor the owner was there. the waiter took two dishes off the bill but i was still angry to pay anything because the food was absolutely the worst i ever had. on top of that this was to be the beginning of a birthday celebration and it turned out awful. \\n\\ni am amazed anyone can stay in business serving food this bad. and i am insulted that this establishment represents both the city of chicago and italian food in such a poor manor. \\n\\n\\navoid at all costs. as a treat and deciding to be a lazy mom night i gave in and ordered a \"pizza hut pizza\" for the kids. i ordered two medium pizzas online with a coupon, no problems. very easy to order. they called 10minutes before the \"estimated delivery time\" to confirm the address and said the pizzas will be there in the next 20 minutes. so after waiting half an hour at least i knew dinner would be here in the next 20 minutes. so 20 minutes came and went. an hour later our luke warm pizzas arrived one of them were even right. the other had a different crust. they were the greasiest half assed pizzas i\\'ve ever seen. \\nif i could give this place zero stars i would. we made a res 3 weeks in advance for a group of 6 and when we arrived we were told our table wasn\\'t available because we \"changed it too many times.\" it was changed once on the day it was made.. needless to say we didn\\'t eat there. don\\'t give someone a reservation if you don\\'t have available tables. please don\\'t answer your phones with \"how can i provide you with excellent service\" if you\\'re not going to do that. jennifer c. answered the phone and was very rude from the start, my friend is a vegetarian and i asked if they had a four cheese pasta she said they had a 5 cheese cd. i asked what it was like and she answered \"just like any other 5 cheese pasta\". there was several other things she said that were just plain rude. i love olive garden but it definitely ruins the experience when you get treated this way. terrible delivery service.  no, might not be enough.  1hr 50min delivery.  pizza was cold, we had to put it in our own oven to heat it.  celery is extra, two sticks of celery?  i hate writing this because i liked this place, absolutely won\\'t be back. if i could give no stars, this would be the place. disappointing. we\\'ve eaten here before and enjoyed our meals. today we had spaghetti and the meatballs tasted like they had been soaked in a chemical. no kidding.  aside from the first bite, both our plates went untouched.  the salad and bread were  good, but the spaghetti was foul.  our waitress didn\\'t bat an eye at our untouched dinner. $40 and i\\'m still hungry.   what a shame, we won\\'t be back. after reading the amazing reviews, i was so excited to try the pizza at bottega!  wow what a let down. the crust is soggy and undercooked (all 6 pizzas ordered) and the woman next to us sent hers back twice before giving up and leaving without eating.  \\nthe arancini was disappointing & dry and didn\\'t come with any marinara.  the bacia was bland. \\ngreat bright decor for a lunch spot but the pizza is just so bad, who cares?!  and this is not just my personal opinion, the tables on both sides of me were also complaining of soggy pizzas! seriously charged $2 to add chocolate chips to my daughters pancakes! food boring and salted to death. they actually counted the fruit....2 grapes, 2 mellon, 2 pineapple and half a slice of dried up pink grapefruit! terrible coffee... that is why \"bottomlesss\"+ bad deco r, terrible paint job and black tape to patch up counter stools. do 2 not waste your time and money. horrible service. waited 15 minutes  before i had to go to the host and tell them we need a server.  then i waited another 15 for a cappuccino  that was cold when ordered hot. waitress disappears again and does not check on us. another 20 minutes go by and best believe i have talked to the manager and leaving because of their horrible service. not to mention that is not even busy! i had to choose 1 star otherwise , i couldn\\'t post this review! this location deserves zero stars! moved here not too long ago.  was going to order me up some pizza.  after reading all the bad reviews i\\'ve decided not to order from this location.  decided to try dominos although i prefer pjp, at least i did back where i used to live.  pjp, are you listening. their pizza gave me food poisoning...twice! i though maybe i had a stomach bug the first time.  the second time, i had to take off work the next day because i was so sick. not ok!!  i should have known.  the employees hands looked filthy and the place was like 100 degrees inside.  pizza places use raw meat for sausage, so if the meat is sitting out in a hot kitchen for hours before it even goes on your food...well you do the math. three times a charm? not at this location! first time in, customer service was terrible. the two girls taking orders at the counter complained the entire time about how swamped their were on a tuesday night and didn\\'t even greet us when we came in.\\n\\nsecond time was a little better, but they change the style of their fried mushrooms than it was the first time we had them. \\n\\nlast time i will go there was last night unless their management changes. i have ordered the pizza and wing special, extra large with two toppings and a side order of fried mushrooms, 30 bucks. this time i just ordered the special extra large two topping pizza with wings with no side of fried mushrooms, price 30 bucks. it didn\\'t make sense to me and i asked the girl working the counter, who was really sweet, how can it be the same price if i didn\\'t order the extra items of mushrooms, she couldn\\'t figure it put. a older man with a white mustache tried to justify the price by saying he put extra wings in my order, which he lied about. i told him the math didn\\'t add up and he proceeded to get mouthy with me telling me, as i am walking out the door, to give him the pizza back. \\n\\ni am all about supporting local business but this manager needs to learn math and customer service. i will not be back anytime soon! had to give it another try. big mistake. the waitress acted like we were a bother to her (there was one other table; it was no where near closing time). she was rude from the minute we sat down until we left even after many attempts to \"kill her with kindness.\"\\n\\nwhat is the point of having \"the best craft beer list\" if your staff knows nothing about the beer, serves it in the wrong glass, and the glass they do serve it in reeks of  bleach and is filthy?\\n\\ni won\\'t be returning and i\\'d advise others to stay away. group of 6 of us are here recently and we\\'re pleased that we could simply walk up and be seated. \\n\\nthe restaurant is clean and nicely decorated. there are television screens dotted about the place so if you want to watch some sport, while you chomp you can. \\n\\nwe ordered a round of beers - the prices here are pretty expensive so we ordered bottles of peroni as these were the cheapest. the waiter who brought us the beers, spilled two bottles over one of our party and absolutely failed to acknowledge any mistake on his part. a simple apology and offer of a cloth is pretty standard when you spill something on someone. \\n\\nthe food was good and we used the free check in offer here from yelp! our real disappointment came when we had got the bill. the waiter had added 18% gratuity to our bill by default. \\n\\nwe emptied our wallets and decided that we were not going to pay the full gratuity given the poor service we had received. instead we decided that we would pay $3 less. as we departed the waiter was quick to point out that we where $3 short! i\\'m sorry but the service didn\\'t warrant the 18% to start with, but by asking us for more cash is plain rude... gratuity is optional not a right!! \\n\\nthis place gets 1 star for the fact that we left so angry at the cheek of the staff!! first time here. horrible service. waited over 15 mins to get anyone to stop at our table. had to go to hostess to complain. won\\'t be coming back. first time ordering from this place. never again! i ordered a large thin crust pizza and 6 med wings. pizza had big, black burnt bubbles on top, along with burnt pepperoni. wings were okay.. very long delivery time. wouldn\\'t recommend first time dining here and wont be back. not worth the money when you have so many other options. my friend\\'s filet was served cold and they completely forgot the side of potatoes until we were finished with the meal. portions, while what they should be were not worth the price. friend is already planning a corn dog run down the street. the busboy was the best part of the experience and kept refilling water and anything we needed. already decided to get dessert elsewhere to avoid yet more disappointment. i ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza to go and when i got home i instantly noticed a large strand of hair on my pizza. some things i can forgive, but this i can\\'t. the staff seemed friendly, but even the pizza doesn\\'t taste very good so i can\\'t really justify a higher rating. i won\\'t be coming back. this is the worst slice of pizza i\\'ve had. the man working heated it up in the microwave and if i wasn\\'t half way through paying i would have left. i believe he was heating up his own tv dinner simultaneously because he sat down to eat it as soon as i left. there were left over pieces of trash on each table. my microwave pizza was gross and friggin chewy. really hard to rate food considering our pizza never made it to our table. on a thursday night entered an almost empty restaurant, just a couple of teenagers finishing up. placed our order at 7:40p (2 pepperoni pizzas), another family arrives 15 mins later places an order and receives their pizza. i finally get the attention of the waitress who seems to be avoiding our area and tells me 5-7 min more. that time passes and we\\'re at 45 min without food and no response other than they had a lot of box orders to fill. what? then how did the other family get their order and finish by 8:30? we finally talk to the manager, basically a kid without a clue. we leave after an hour without eating and rejecting a $15 off coupon to a restaurant where we can\\'t get served. horrible! i called to place an order over the phone for pick up and the girl was terrible. she put me on hold and then picked up six or seven times to talk to me, but then kept placing me on hold.  i was told my pizza would take 20-25 mins. i got to east west pizza 25 minutes after placing my order and was told that it would take another 30 minutes from the time i paid for it. from the time i placed my order to the time i walked out of the restaurant it was over an hour. i thought this pizza better be great considering how long i waited for it and how much i paid for it (it was $18 for a large with two toppings). i took it home and ate it and threw more then half of it away. it was not good at all! their toppings are very bland. there is nothing special about this pizza at all. it is obviously from all frozen products. they brag about their cheese on the top of the box and it is tasteless and disgusting! i would never go back!! if i could give them negative stars i would. do not go to east west pizza. go to grimaldis or something. it is not worth the $18 i paid or the hour i waited!!! way over priced. during happy hour their well drinks are  $9!!    nothing happy about a $9 drink\\nexplains why the place is empty\\nless than 3 miles down the road at the tavern grill they offer top shelf drinks for $3.50 plus the food is something that you want to eat.\\nwon\\'t be returning to ventura if i were you do not eat here they were on arizonas dirty dining list. cock roaches and don\\'t wash hands. and they bring desert after dinner and show you all the pies and you think it\\'s free but they are not..... then they don\\'t let you use groupon and they are very rude. worst phone service ever. why do you ask to tell he the specials but i say no i already know what i want. you put me on hold for 5min. then i call back and you ask if i want to hear specials again. i say no i know what i want and you still ask me to hold. and i tell you i was on hold for 5min already and i know what i want. so you put me on hold. 5 more minutes and still nothing. guess i\\'ll go somewhere else. phone orders are just as important as anyone else. horrible customer service! called for delivery to crescent heights...  it clearly states on their menu they deliver to this area. was told my address was pushing the limits and not even given an option to pay more for a delivery fee (which i happily would\\'ve done if i had been treated nicer !).\\ni google mapped it after the phone call and it was 3.1 km and a 7 min drive! guess the 0.1 over their limit is too much for them  !! \\n obviously this place does not care to bring more revenue to their business. doesnt matter how good your pizza is supposed to be if u continue to treat customers like this ! consistently disappointing.\\n\\ni love supporting small business and  have been going to this place since it opened.  i am continually overlooking their faults because i love their eggplant sandwich but i now realize it is a place i will not be going to anymore.\\n\\nusually my issues are with the service, which is not a surprise since i never consistently see the same faces there.  \\n\\ni have had a problem with the server overtipping themselves on my credit card.  i luckily noticed on a statement.   i did have this issue resolved but it took many calls for this to happen.\\n\\nif you stay and eat there, the place is often very messy.  i have seen servers walk past a broom that had fallen in the middle of the floor instead of picking it up and putting it away.  i have seen servers pull tables apart, while people were sitting at them on game nights, even though the whole place was empty and the tables were not needed at that point. \\n\\nmy last (and it will be final) experience made me the most disappoint. i had made a to- go order.  i was surprised at how expensive it was this particular time.    i soon learned they are different menus for \"game nights\" (hockey games, etc) and apparently you are charged more even on to-go orders, which i find ridiculous.   my sandwich that i usually get costs almost $2 more and on this particular time the bread was burnt.  it is not that great of a place to go to, to spend that much money and i was frustrated that they price gauge, even on to go order to make a couple extra dollars on game nights.   there are definitely better places to go at westgate. called an hour after my order was placed online to check on my order status. was told by the manager that he cancelled my order and credit card transaction because i had an incorrect phone number. have previously ordered before several times. i will take my business elsewhere ordered a large chicken parm and it showed up dry and crispy. as if i had paid $25.00 for a great value box pizza. i called and asked if i could have it replaced and that i would gladly return the old one. the woman i talked to on the phone was polite, the manager on the other hand was not. not only did he argue with me on whether or not he personally put sauce on the pizza but he made it out of his way to make me feel inconvenient. from a frequent visitor, it makes me apprehensive to order again , especially when the manager doesn\\'t have time for me. i have given state 48 multiple shots. sometimes the food is amazing. sometimes it\\'s mediocre. but in my opinion, if you provide good service, mediocre food can fly. unfortunately, their service is a joke. honestly, the owner/owners bit off way more than they could chew.. and it consistently shows. this place was always great in the past but my recent visit there sucked! the waiter was absolutely horrible! i asked him 4 times for refills, asked him several times for more breadsticks, for silverware, and i never got any! i had to go and take the silverware from another table. had to go find someone for a refill and for the breadsticks and still never got those breadsticks! and everrrrrryone who knows and goes there, knows its all about them breadsticks!\\nthen to make matters worse, we asked for the bill....he never brought it! so we just got up  and went to the front and asked them for it and then he had the nerve to get upset at us because we didn\\'t leave a tip and we complained! so sad, but the scottsdale location down on osborn and scottsdale rd is not a great experience, at least not anymore the people who take the order and cook the food had bad attitudes and were hard to understand because they don\\'t speak clearly or loudly enough. none of the food i ordered was good. the dessert i had to go was also terrible and there were strands of hair inside the container. never coming back again. went here last saturday with my husband. do not bother going. we should have known with it being a saturday night and not a sole in the restaurant. drinks were ok, dinner still took forever even though it was just us. will never go back. i wish that i could give a better review because the food is good and it is right down the street from where i live but after many disappointments, i cannot recommend this spot with a good conscience.\\n\\nthe management is absolutely horrid.  on our first visit, the manager asked us to sit at the bar to wait for a table- in a completely empty restaurant.  we waited and were seated about 5 minutes later.  once seated, the manager micromanaged our server- cutting her off, getting in the way of us ordering, and contradicting her.  i felt terrible as she was doing a great job with our service. despite the management issues, the food was good so we returned.  \\n\\nthe next few visits were similar to the first- the manager lacks complete social skills and should not be in the front of house.  it would probably benefit the restaurant to have her stay away from the tables and patrons.  nonetheless, we loved the food and just attempted to steer clear of her.\\n\\nthe last straw was the purchase of our groupon.  after attempting to make an email reservation, we received a reply email simply asking, \"if we had a groupon\".   when i answered \"yes\", we were told that we would not be able to redeem the deal but could use the value at the restaurant at some other time.  ha!  i responded with a none to pleased email to which i received some sob story from the manager stating that she was the owner and sole operator due to a \"series of unfortunate events\".  instead of offering some other compromise, i was told not to be so harsh and judgmental.\\n\\ni don\\'t believe that i was being harsh at all by simply trying to redeem our groupon by getting a table for two in the imminent future.  \\n\\nbottom line: 1) do not sell groupons that you can\\'t fulfill, 2) work with your customers to come up with a solution, 3) hire a social appropriate manager so that you are able to retain those that have been good to you.\\n\\nfuture potential customers: i would not suggest buying any deals that come from this place and at best, only do takeout.\\n\\ni personally, will never be back and even asked groupon for a refund. so sad. ordered a taco pizza, we are from iowa and grew up with this pizza. the waitress came out and said they accidentally put sour cream on it , we said that\\'s ok we would still take it. pizza came out cold and boneless wings were frozen and not what you would ever expect at a pizza joint. terrible experience all the way around. girl that worked there was more concerned about people in the back and at the bar and going to ride her horse. terrible experience and will never be back. joe whitty would be ashamed of this establishment !!!!! terrible service. ladies at the front didn\\'t want to sit me since i was by myself. said i would have to wait for an hour even though there were plenty of tables. walked out! absolutely disappointed to the point i will probably never return. we went for dinner after the dinner rush at 7pm, this place was super noisy to the point where we couldn\\'t have a conversation with people at the table. seemed like they were seating by the rooms vs by server, so once one room was filled up they would seat in another area. \\n\\nmy biggest complaint is that i ordered veal marsala, my veal was very overcooked and tough to even cut into, i did tell our server who swapped out for chicken marsala however it took them about 40 minutes and by the time i was super annoyed and not hungry let alone my friends and family were already finished eating. also, two people at my table ordered meatballs, they were also overcooked and came to the table luke warm, they were not eaten and asked to be taken off the bill. the manager said that the meatballs were boiled and probably at the bottom of the pot and not stirred. \\n\\nchristina was our server and probably the only thing positive i can say was that she was very sweet and accommodating however i would suggest giving this girl a promotion to manager as the manager who came to speak with us never introduced himself, had a bad attitude and did the bare minimum by taking the meatballs and marsala off the bill but his attitude wasn\\'t one of a manager should have. the only way i knew his name was that his initials are on the bill and it on the door. \\n\\nand for a suggestion.....it would be really nice if they offered gluten-free pasta for those of us with allergies since they are a pasta establishment. i had 5 things to choose from, and 3 of those i couldn\\'t eat...you know the rest of the two other options. meh! we took a chance on this place we\\'ve passed up for 8 years. should have kept going...now we know. our takeout chicken marsala was mediocre with low quality noodles. unfortunately our chicken tequila didn\\'t come with the chicken. they offered to make one with chicken so i had to go back in the middle of our meal to get it before they closed. they also forgot the dressing we asked for, though the order taker repeated our order request. went in after the beer fest for dinner 6 of us . we have been their three different times after the beer fest and was very good but this year it was like a new place wow the service was good but the food we ordered was bottom of the barrel and way over priced.\\n2 hamburger steak dinners that were so over done we could not finnish them. 2 prime ribs one was ok the second very well done and didn\\'t get the baked potato so they brought french fries at the end of the meal ?. 1 dinner was ravioli it had three small ravs hardly no sauce . 1 dinner was chicken parmesan it was ok .\\nall the salads so much dressing it was running off the plates.\\nand not 1 of these were priced under $15.00. \\nwe will not be going back. sunday evening, me and some coworkers went for dinner at east side mario\\'s. we entered and were greeted by the hostess and who seemed unenthused and not very friendly. i asked if we could have a table of 5 and she said in a few minutes or we could take the empty table that everyone was avoiding as it\\'s right by the door where the draft from customers walking in out was a target. in -11 weather...no thanks. we decided to wait.\\n\\nit took about 10 min to seat a party of 5 even though were about 3-4 tables that needed to be cleared in sight. finally seated, our server came by and introduced himself. my manager wanted to clarify that it was a work event and just needed to let him know of the pay arrangements in advance so that he wasnt\\' bombarded. he responded apprehensive as if the request was out-to-lunch. \"uh...i dunno. i mean, i can ask but i \\'m not sure so i dunno.\" he didnt\\' seem interested in trying to cater at all.\\n\\nour drinks arrived in a timely manner but me and my manager both ordered 8 oz glasses of wine. so, why were our glasses not even? hers looked like a 6 oz and mine a 8oz. i asked why they are uneven for the same oz size. he just replied \"uh maybe the waiter who poured it in the back spilled some.\" ??? he then made no attempt to try to rectify it and my manager didn\\'t want to make a big deal so we let it go.\\n\\nwe never got our food until about 45 min after we  recieved our drinks. the same waiter mentioned something about a problem with it being punched in. we weren\\'t offered any perks to make up for the mistake either. after our meals came out, a new waitress came and said that our old waiter got stressed out and decided to go home. couldn\\'t have been from our table because we didn\\'t say anything bad to him or confusing at all. when it was time to get our bills, they screwed up everyone\\'s orders and we ended up just writing it down for them to straighten it out as drinks and meals were scattered randomly on different bills. \\n\\nthe food was ok, i orded baked penne bolognese. the price wasn\\'t bad either. it was under the all you can eat salad/soup with garlic bread for $12.99. the wine was good too but the customer service was kinda crappy. this rating is specifically for this location. the chain itself is acceptable, as others have stated you come here for convenience and cheaper prices. \\n\\ni come to this location occasionally because it\\'s close to work. everytime i come, they don\\'t have veggie, which is the only thing i want. they actually don\\'t have a lot of ready made options available. i think it\\'s because the store owner is facing demand and doesn\\'t want a lot of leftovers. i get that, but i come at lunch and they will be opened for the rest of the day, into the evening. veggie is also a pretty popular choice, so i think that\\'s unacceptable. \\n\\nlike one reviewer mentioned here previously, they are reluctant to make more pizzas. as i\\'m sitting in the store eating and writing this review, i see 5-6 more customers request for veggie. only then did they agree to make a veggie pizza. it\\'s ridiculous though because now everyone needs to wait 15 mins for their pizza, when the expectation was grab and go. people may be getting a freshly made pizza, but it\\'s business hours and everyone is busy trying to get back to work. i would never recommend this place to anyone.  this is twice that i have ordered food from this pizzeria and just received the worst service. from the moment you call to order to picking up the food , it has just been a bad experience.  the lady at the front always seems sad or upset , the rest of the staff never greets or smiles.  no wonder this place us always empty. good luck in the future but for now you lost this family as customers. gus\\' was created by a person i assume was like, \"hey man, college kids get drunk, can\\'t drive, and want pizza delivered at all hours of the night.\"\\n\\nthus, there is this crap hole pizza place that is run by the mentally challenged.  at my high school it was the special ed kids that always served our lunches in the cafeteria, then all those kids moved to tempe and got a job here.  the biggest problem with this place is that the staff is totally careless and incompetent and i imagine on some or all drugs during work. \\n\\nactually, that\\'s a lie, the biggest problem is the pizza is gross.  it tastes like when you make a frozen tombstone pizza at night, take it out, then you don\\'t want it anymore so you leave it on the counter instead of wrapping it up cause you want to get back to watching hoarders on a&e.  \\n\\nthen you wake up the next morning and you\\'re like, \"oh, cool, left over frozen tombstone pizza that\\'s been sitting out all night.\"  so you put it in the microwave to nuke all the bacteria and get it out of the temperature danger zone.\\n\\nthen you eat it and you\\'re like, \"wow this tastes just like gus\\' pizza only slightly better.\" this mouthy dago needs a lesson in customer service. plus he treats his help like crap. ( a true test of an asshle owner) you idiots that pass off this poor behavior as new york -ese  should go back there. my fiancé and i moved here a couple weeks ago and have our temporary licenses. when we went to buy a beverage before the pirates game the lady said it was their \"personal policy\" not to serve anyone with temporary licenses. i didn\\'t know restaurants could trump state laws. the lady was very rude, i would not recommend this place to anyone. i also heard other customers complain about how they were being treated during their visit. the customer may not always be right but they\\'re the one paying your pay check.. might want to remember that if you\\'re going to run a successful business. as most new restaurants do, the owners and managers encourage their staff and friends to write good reviews. the reason i brought that up was because an acquaintance told me she has eaten there and is friends with an employee and was asked to write a good review. i can only assume several of the positive reviews are such.\\n well, i tried it with my wife last yesterday afternoon. this restaurant used to be a sushi restaurant, we were excited to see another restaurant come to town. the waitress was friendly and polite. i had to take a double take at the prices on the menu. $17 for chicken $30 for a steak! i thought to myself, this place is no ruth chris. i went with the rotisserie chicken. my wife went for a cesar salad. when our meal arrived i couldn\\'t  have been more disappointed. first off, i told the server i was on a no carb diet, she recommended the rotisserie chicken. it was covered in barbecue sauce, wth? my wife said just scrape it off and remove the skin. it was supposed to be a half of chicken. \"it was a complete joke\" miniature chicken or game hen, either way it was only a small leg & thigh. the sever asked how was everything? i replied, wasn\\'t this supposed to be a half of chicken? she said, \"yes but they a very small birds\" about five minutes pass and the manager came over and defended the miniature chicken. he said, they do use a very small bird and he ask the cook if he made a mistake and not cut the chicken in half. he assured me, i got half of the bird. trust me, i know chicken, that wasn\\'t half,  i\\'m not a big fan of white meat, i usually take it home and use it for a salad.  anyway, he apologized and comped my $17 leg and thigh.\\n i can honestly say the $5.99 whole rotisserie chicken fry\\'s sells has better flavor and is worth every penny. compared to their recipe, fry\\'s, safeway, bashas\\'s and walmart do a better job.\\n the brew was good and priced competitively. they offer happy hour before 6pm $2.00 off each beer and appetizer. if we go back, and that is a \"big if\" that is all we\\'ll go back for. the dinner is extremely overpriced, small portions and flavorless. i wish i didn\\'t even have to give them a star. i\\'m not one to complain, i love to see the success of new business\\' and restaurants and really wish(ed) them the best. so naturally with cibo being a new restaurant i wanted to check it out and see what everyone was raving about.\\n\\nwhen walking in to the establishment it was very nice, clean, very rustic looking with a very nice lay out. we were seated upstairs which was very loft like and urban . like mentioned the staff are underdressed and blend in with patrons dining. no way to really tell who works there and who doesn\\'t. \\n\\nwe sat down and weren\\'t served anything to drink for about 10-15 mins, didn\\'t know who our server was up until that point and when served were greeted with a waitress who was less than charismatic, treated us more like her friend than paying guests, throwing out her friends names of dishes (unpronounceable to most who don\\'t speak italian) like \"the fag\" (i\\'m not kidding) short for whatever the dish she was referring to was called. meanwhile before we\\'ve even ordered, food runners are asking us if \"this\" is what we ordered - they have no clue what table was what and walked around aimlessly with food in their hand until directed by the server to point them to the table. this continued even throughout our meal. after a being open a few weeks how is this happening?\\n\\nwe ordered a few starters which came and were quite good - maybe not to die for but palatable at the very least. up next was our main course. i ordered a pasta dish that had broccolini, sausage, tons of garlic and even more olive oil than you could imagine. first few bites were very good! as i continued through the plate i put a big leaf like thing into my mouth- thinking how out of place and odd it was to have a mix of broccolini and leafy  vegetable in the pasta but didn\\'t think too much of it. after putting it into my mouth i immediately spat it out, obviously this wasn\\'t meant to be in the dish - maybe some sort of garnish?? no idea. put it the the side of my plate briefly and realized that again something wasn\\'t right. picked it up and saw that there was a date on it. turns out it was a 4\" piece of green painters tape with a \"best before\" date that obviously the kitchen uses to date their food. i informed the waitress of the issue and before i could tell her not to bring me another dish the plate was gone and so was she.\\n\\nwhen she came back with the new dish she says \"you know, i thought the dish looked extra green, but thought they\\'d just added more broccolini, they\\'re always changing things up on me so never second guessed it! you know, we usually keep an eye out for things like hairs and stuff\" (yet a giant piece of painters tape went unnoticed? is ashton kutcher going to jump out and tell me i\\'m being punked? am i on some \"what would you do\" dateline show and john quinones is going to come out with a camera crew?? nope, this is happening). no apology, instead just laughed off as if that slip up wasn\\'t a big deal.  she left, came back to check how my (untouched) second meal was and added \"no tape i hope!\" where in the world is the professionalism? making light of something so disgusting is inexcusable. when i told her i couldn\\'t eat it i was then asked if i\\'d like it to go, i declined. we weren\\'t seated far from the pos station where they ring in orders when i over heard our waitress request that the manager comp a dish - his first response was \"why?\" in anger/disgust. when she explained the situation, he replied with an \"oh, ok\"\\n\\nsince this was brought to a managers attention i\\'d expect someone to apologize, take ownership for something like this happening! he passed by the table several times (probably didn\\'t know which table he comped was, the food runners didn\\'t so i wouldn\\'t be surprised) and nothing.\\n\\nwe were given our bill (which i\\'m surprised we given) but we left money on the table and decided to get out and go somewhere else where the service would be better for evening drinks. as we walked out of the building and walked maybe 8 feet from the entrance our waitress came barreling out the doors shouting down 17 avenue with many bystanders nearby \"ladies, you didn\\'t pay the full amount of your tab!!!\" not only did we pay, we also left a good tip when she realized she had more than the bill we got no apology , just a \"oh my bad, i\\'m such a moron\" stuck out her hand and said \"slap me\"  slap your hand? \\n\\nlater i posted about how i was bummed out by the experience. today i got a message from the manager (same guy from last night) asking me to call him. couldn\\'t handle it in person? when i asked for his boss\\' info i was ignored and told \"i take full responsibility, and would \\'appreciate\\' it if you dealt with me\" too little too late. only time i\\'ll go back is when its a new restaurant w/ experienced staff.\\n\\nsupremely disappointed in staff and lack of ownership/responsibility when i was present. now i\\'m gone he wants to jump through hoops? give me a break! this place is absolutely bull s**t how can it possibly take 2 hours to make a pizza and chicken wings and deliver it when i live at most 10 minutes away. on top of taking that long the pizza was cold chicken was cold no sauce for breadsticks whoever\\'s in charge needs to be replaced. if i could give 0 stars i would. i just got home from picking up an order to go at your oregano\\'s restaurant on bell road in glendale az. i am on crutches because i have broken bones in my foot. when i arrived one of the handicap spots was taken by a white pickup truck without handicap plates or a hang tag. i was in my car for a few minutes gathering my purse and crutches and watched one of the employees loading food into the truck. when i went in to pay for my food i asked to speak to the manager. the manager came out and when i voiced a concern that an employee was taking up one of only two handicap parking spots he responded with \"this is private property and we can do whatever we want\" - i then stated that the city of glendale may have a different opinion of that  and the manager said : \"do you have a handicap plate\" when i said that i did he asked me if it is because i am a veteran. when i told him that it was because i have broken foot (mind you he can see i am on crutches and with a boot on my foot) he said \" oh well i have a handicap parking plate as well because i am a veteran\" and then walked back into the kitchen. very disappointing that this is the type of service your company provides. i will never spend my money there again as i choose to spend my hard earned money somewhere that customers are treated with courtesy. my daughter and i were excited to order pizza tonight but ended with dissatisfaction originally the pizza arrived in poor condition with cheese missing at the crust edges and piled in the center it also was missing the garlic butter i had ordered we called the store and were told they were sending a replacement after an hour and 10 minutes  later we called because it had not arrived they awnsered the phone by saying pizza hut even though it was clearly papa john\\'s we were then told the pizza had left 10 minutes ago it finally arrived after a total of an hour and 20 minutes and this was my remake it looked much better but by this time it was 5 minutes till 10 next time i order it will not be from here as my child and i are now eating at 10 o clock when my original order was put in at 7:59 very dissatisfied with the service and lack of professionalism was told order would be ready in 15 minutes for pick up.  got there and was told that they were out of pizza and out of wings!!! it\\'s saturday night at 10 pm.  that\\'s f\\'ed up.  no apologies and no attempt to make ammends.  not cool, pizza hut. not cool. didn\\'t even get a chance to order. incredibly rude over the phone, unfriendly and not helpful at all. pretty sure i was going to get spit pizza anyway. 0 stars if i could..... food was not spectacular, service was good but over priced for under whelming food. won\\'t return. food was fine but possibly the worst service i\\'ve ever had. not servers fault, she was alone in an almost full restaurant. i was extremely disappointed as i saw a mouse run by while eating my pizza and upon pointing this out the restaurant didn\\'t do anything about it like pay for the bill ! \\ngiven i went out for dinner only to see a mouse was disappointing.\\nlastly i\\'d like to add this was the second time i saw it last time was ~ 4 months ago so clearly nothing was done about that issue. well all i can say is beware. i believe the food i received was not prepared on property. it needs many improvements. window and floors needed cleaning crap! no really the worst pizza ever will never order it again. threw it out after one bite!!! not very pleased with the manager. not friendly at all. drinks on the other hand are good but people also make the atmosphere. if i could give it negative stars, i would. how the heck this place is still open is beyond me. the restaurant itself i believe used to be a retail store, and they didn\\'t do much to change the layout. it\\'s very cavernous, and it looks like the furniture was all either taken from various rooms in someone\\'s house, or purchased a yard sale. nothing is cohesive. decorations on the wall are very weirdly arranged and old, and the food order area is very sloppy and disruptive to the flow of the restaurant. \\ni got a corned beef sandwich, and it was very poorly made. it looked like they cut the meat blindfolded and the bread was taken right out of the bag. it tasted even worse. i ate about half and then gave up. my fiance got a salad, and it had the same sloppy appearance as the sandwich, only it sounded like the taste was actually worse. the dressing tasted like dimetapp, and the chicken on top looked like it had been boiled until it was halfway cooked. just an embarrassing and awful display by these owners. \\ni almost feel bad writing this because i know it\\'s difficult to start and run a restaurant, but this was one of the sloppiest, dingiest, worst places i have ever eaten in my life. there is a dearth of decent, non-chain lunch spots in sewickley, but any hope you had for east coast sandwiches, forget about it. we waited 25 minutes to be seated and the table was in the middle of the waiters walk way. the food took over another 30 minutes to get for a grilled chicken salad and chicken caprese sandwich. it\\'s the second week of spring training and they are not prepared to be this busy according to our server. bogo cocktail turned out to be bogus. the server informed me that the deal was no longer valid \\'because we\\'re changing things up around here\\'. tried to order my usual ketel and tonic, but was informed there was no ketel. place gets zero stars, but i\\'ll add one because the bartender (different girl than the server) was \\'super sorry\\' she couldn\\'t do the bogo deal / they didn\\'t have any ketel in the place. terrible terrible terrible. shouldn\\'t even be considered manhattan pizza i am from nyc and let me tell you i know hat pizza in lv will never be nyc pizza but this was absolutely disgusting, the cheese was all over the place the pepperoni was like sandwich style the sauce was just all over it was a terrible pizza bad service. took a while for rhe table fo get clean so we can sit. waited a while after asking for a high chair. did give us refills dodnt give us bread sticks. but everyone even the manager stoped to tslk n see if everything was ok st s workers table. not a good restaurant awful!   i read the reviews and when i saw the photo of the bucatini all\\'amatriciana i had to try it.   we started with a caprese salad that had little to no flavor.  when my bucatini all\\'amatriciana it was nothing like the photo..it was not even bucatini...my a homemade pasta mess of a bad and soggy fetuccini.  the sauce had no flavor.   the italian manager tried to explain to me that is was bucatini all\\'amatriciana and i could see he was having a horrible time trying to hide the fact he agreed it was not.  i think replaced it with a tri-colore salad that was basically an over-dressed mixed green.   i figured you can\\'t go wrong with desert so we ordered the apple pie desert with homemade gelato that will go down in history as the worst desert i\\'ve had.   the ice cream had zero flavor and my friend and i were in shock.  i would skip this!!! i came here for lunch with a co-worker, the waitress (who has short black hair and a thick accent) seated us at our table and completely disregarded as for over 30 minutes, until i called her over asking for bread (that they always bring over), 7 minutes later she came back with 4 pieces of cold bread. she brought over our food, i ordered the chef\\'s recommendation which was the tortellini - the portion size was incredibly small and it only came with four thinly sliced sausages. my co-worker ordered the fettuccine with mushrooms (don\\'t remember the exact title) it was incredibly bland, basically it was fettuccine, some mushrooms, and heavy cream, it had absolutely no flavor. the waitress only offered us black pepper and did not offer us parmigiana cheese, when in fact she offered it to everyone else. when i asked for more bread, she came back 10 minutes later with more cold bread, i had to ask her to bring us fresh bread, she disappeared for another 5 minutes and came back with hot bread (which i\\'m 100% was just microwaved).\\n\\nall in all, i would not recommend this place to anyone. not unless you really like bad service and bland tasting food. wanted to like this place. pizza was ok but not seating. walk back and forth if you want a beer and or wine had to walk back and forth between buildings was so so. i love joe\\'s but this was a pain to just get a slice of pizza a beer and a glass of wine too much!!!!! definitely won\\'t be coming back. we came in to celebrate a friends birthday. we ordered the caesar salad- dressing tasted like mayo :/,  fried calamari appetizer- over cooked, the garlic knots- tasted decent, but we waited 30 minutes for the \"dough to rise\"(?), pineapple and prosciutto pizza- gross, cardboard tasting crust, and the meat lovers pizza- gross, but not as bad as the other pizza. \\nthe service was awful, and our waitress had zero customer service skills. we were also in a lazy mood and ordered in... the pizza came more quickly than we had anticipated! which was good because we were hungry... about 3 bites in a found a long dark hair in my pizza... my wife trying to make me feel better assured me that it was probably hers. we both knew it wasn\\'t. we started feeling much less hungry and as my wife went to throw the rest of the pizza away she found a big, black, nasty fly baked right in... yum! \\n\\nmaybe they were just having a bad day... but regardless we won\\'t be ordering from them again... my wife makes better homemade pizza anyways... i loved olive garden but after today it\\'s the worst restaurant ever! we have a 3 month old girl and a almost 3 year old is its a little hard to go out, we usually let out 3 year old watch a movie on his tablet when we eat so he can sit still and let us eat. a few hour after we left we had realized that we left it. when we went back to pick it up the said \"we are honest people\" i hate people that steal specially from a three-year-old! the worse meal out in the five years i\\'ve been in phoenix. for starter i ordered pork bites and greens.  with no meat at all, just chunks of fat.  entree ordered was a hot chicken served with cornbread.  i received a leg and thigh (no white meat) heavily greasy breading which tasted like louisiana hot sauce and paprika/  there was a big hunk of dry, cold inedible cornbread with some mystery white stuff drizzled on top....should never have been served.  the side of mashed potatoes though cold had good flavor.  our server was fine and i felt sorry for him due to the awful food.  meal and tip was 50.00 .....needless to say, i will never go back. unless they get new chefs with high food standards, this place wont last.  yuck went to hey last week for a late late afternoon snack (otherwise known as \"lupper\"). the restaurant was empty except for 5 other customers. i ordered a calzone, which was actually pretty yummy. my server was great, and things were looking pretty good until she vanished, never to be seen again! left to my own devices, i finally got up and buttonholed a server who was playing close attention to the table next to me. she appeared quite indifferent when i complained, but did respond to my request for dessert. i found myself feeling grateful for the attention (always a bad sign in a restaurant). of course, once it came time to pay my bill, she showed no signs of bringing it to my table until i has thrown on my coat, at this point considering the possibility of a dine and dash. \\n\\nreally hey, really??? the restaurant is almost empty and your servers can\\'t be bothered to look after their customers? lame. and one last thing: you never serve bread pudding ice cold. it wasn\\'t the most incredible bread pudding to start (mabels up the street on ronces owns that honor), but a little heat and a little whipped cream might just have warmed my inner bitch. awful awful awful. never order food here. its all from bags of frozen junk. i think we\\'ve tried 3 times and it got worse each time. i actually got sick from it the last time. we warn everyone we know not to eat there. this was always one of my favorite downtown restaurants.   i haven\\'t gone in over 15 years and had been looking forward to a pleasurable, relaxing birthday dinner.  but no,  we got the rudest, unfriendly, uncaring waiter and the food lack the pizazz i so fondly remember.  this was an expensive disappointment.  don\\'t go! this place does not even deserve 1 star. my husband and i decided to order take out from this place a few nights ago because we wanted wings but didn\\'t feel like driving anywhere and this place is across the street from our house. let me start off by saying that it took over an hour for them to deliver 2 orders of wings literally right across the street. then, when we finally received our order it was completely wrong, my wings and fries were not crispy at all, and my husbands were burnt to a crisp! also there was maybe 15 fries on each order and hardly any sauce. my husband called to speak with the manager and he said he would send the delivery guy to come pick up our food!! after we had already started eating it because we were starving after having to wait over an hour! then the manager rudely offered to replaced one order of wings on our next visit. so, today after my daughters dance class we decided that we would stop in to get our free wings only to be yelled at by the manager who was telling me that i was wrong and he made our previous order perfectly! who are you to tell me how i like my wings sir?! he also said that after this we could start going somewhere else to get our wings because he \"doesn\\'t need our business\". long story short, the owner of this business is a prick and is rude to his customers! not to mention it is completely over priced and the quality of food sucks. this guy deserves to have his doors closed for the way he treats his customers! i will never ever go here again. do not order from this location\\n\\ni ordered a large grilled cheese stuffed pizza , i was called ad told that they are out of grilled cheese ad they only have regular cheese. i was annoyed because i wanted to try the new   product  but it was fine it happens . but this just the beginning the pizza was oily and soggy [check pictures ] . the previous time i ordered from this location the send me a pizza with the wrong toppings . this is a poorly manged location . what a waste of my money . i loved this place but they just got hit with a consumer alertafter an inspection turned up more than a dozen serious food safety violations. today is june 20, 2017.\\n\\ndetails linked here from the post-gazette and are available from the health dept. so you have to decide for yourself.\\nhttp://www.post-gazette.com/business/healthcare-business/2017/06/20/beta-bites-inspection-consumer-alert/stories/201706200107\\n\\ni\\'m rooting for them - i hope they pull it back together. i had a terrible dinner experience here over the weekend.  i ordered my usual spaghetti and meatball, but there was something wrong with my entree.  the pasta was so over cooked in places that it was hard, the meatball was cold (i could not eat it), and the meal left me sick for the entire next day.  it seemed like the dish had been sitting out for hours and gone bad.  disappointing and also concerning in terms of food safety. i am gluten intolerant and needed to have my meal gluten free.  they had no more gluten free pasta, and the waitress was clueless as to what was gluten free.  i asked for a plain piece of chicken with marinara sauce.  she brought out my meal..with chicken on top of a plate of spaghetti and told me it was gluten free.  i told her it was not gluten free, and she took it to the kitchen, removed the spaghetti, and brought the same piece of chicken back.  i experienced an allergic reaction as a result of this contamination.  prior to this, she dumped salad dressing all over my shirt and did not apologize.  i was charged for a full chicken parmigiana meal, when all i got was a plain piece of chicken.  will not be returning here. came here for a late night snack....and thank goodness we came right before midnight on a saturday night because the restaurant closes at midnight.  really? this is vegas! nothing should ever close!\\n\\nwe perused the menu and didn\\'t think it was worth sitting down in the restaurant when it was just the two of us so stood in the line for pizza by the slice.  we got one slice of all the pizzas available...so there was barely any pizza left after we finished.  we came during the rush so you would think they would be preparing more pizzas.  \\n\\nwe noticed that the person who ordered before us had their pizza warmed up.  this was never offered to us.  the pizza slices aren\\'t too expensive but for how greasy and bland the pizza is, i wouldn\\'t have even paid the $6/slice and would have just starved until the morning and eaten at a buffet.\\n\\nthe white pizza was gross (cold, hard/flavorless cheese).  the slice with sausage and pizza was greasy.  the margherita pizza was completely forgettable.  eating here just made me angry thinking about the other pizza option across the way...accept no imitations.  there\\'s only one true great pizza in vegas.  and this place isn\\'t it. problem #1: food is not as fresh as you\\'d think. checked parm was soggy on bottom and top upon arrival (seemed like it was microwaved after fried earlier that day). mozzarella that was on top was shredded, not fresh sliced balls (which i expect when the price of simple chicken parm is $17), and tomatoes that made the sauce were out of a can (although the sauce itself was seasoned right, i get italian for fresh, not canned). \\n\\nproblem #2: the food came out wrong. we both ordered chicken parm, end of communication with waiter, yet, each came with a different side. the waiter literally said \"well, you know, you sometimes never know what\\'s coming out of the kitchen.\" and didn\\'t offer any compensation for it. oh, and he didn\\'t offer appetizers or desert. \\n\\nwhich bring me to problem #3: the waiter seemed completely capable of excelling at his job, but you could tell he lost his motivation somewhere down the line. his lack of enthusiasm and emotion made me feel he was condescending (and i know he wasn\\'t trying to be). he rushed us to table, and out of restaurant. in fact, he grabbed his tip before we finished our drinks and left. \\n\\n\\noverall: the place needs new management. you can tell there is no oversight. the cooks cooked food wrong, the waiter didn\\'t notice till we showed him, front of house is willing to blame back of house in attempt to defend restaurant, attitude of waiter was, like, really odd, and food is not fresh.\\n\\ni will not return, and likely poke fun of it for a good while with my friends.... if you want good italian food, keep searching. if you want a good laugh, try to get the waiter i got. this place has obnoxiously slid their menu into my apartment door dozens of times this year. \"voted best pizza in vegas!\" why lie so blatantly when it takes 2 seconds to look this place up on yelp. pathetic. this meal was horrible. i ordered a calzone. the bottom was completely black - way overcooked. by the time it was delivered,  it was extremely tough. my husband ordered a philly.  he too was disappointed. we won\\'t be eating here again. this place was a huge disappointment. after hearing how it had been recognized on the food network, i went there with a friend on a sunday evening and found the food to be mediocre and overpriced. the waiter also tried desperately to get us to purchase wine and sides. i finally relented to an order of garlic bread, and was served plain, stale bread. for this stale bread, we got charged $3. i will not be going back. if you want italian, red devil is a better deal with a nicer atmosphere and better wait staff.. oh yeah, the bread is good and complimentary. this was my first time in this restaurant and my last.  so disappointed.  got seated okay.  although we knew it was family style we figured they would have a few items you could order individually if necessary.  nope.  one person ordered an appetizer and it was $18 - no larger than a normal appetizer at another restaurant.  the portions were fine for pasta. we got the chicken carbonara and there would have been plenty for 3-4 people.  priced around $25 for the small. we forced someone to take leftovers but i am sure they will be chucked in the bin.  so the food was meh ... the service - well there really wasn\\'t any.  once our food was served the waiter flew by not stopping and asked over his shoulder if everything was ok.  he didn\\'t slow down to wait for our reply. we sat at the table and discussed our horrible experience for about 15 minutes with all our dirty plates after we finished eating before another person who worked there came over.  got the check, failed to put our $20 off on it. more waiting.  also when we ordered beers he didn\\'t ask what size so we got the big ones (we would have ordered the small) - who knew they offered two sizes.  overall for the price and experience if you want this type of food go to olive garden.   i don\\'t know how they stay in business because it was pretty empty when we were there 6:00pm on a thursday night. \\ni know there are people who do love this chain - but it\\'s not for me or the other family i was with. i like the taste of their lobster roll, tastes great but its so expensive that i don\\'t think i want to come back: for $15 you get some lobster with a lot of mayo stuffed inside hotdog buns. not my idea of a good meal. this was one of the worst meals i\\'ve ever had. the one star is for the delivery driver and the bottle water.\\ni ordered medium hot wings, french fries and a small salad. when i received my order, the grease was leaking through the brown bad. when i opened the container, all i saw was soggy french fries on top of my wings. i had to use a towel because the grease was seeping onto the table. i bit into very bland wings. they tasted like they were cooked with no seasoning. i ordered hot wings, and these were not hot wings by any stretch. the only benefit was that the wings were large. the salad didn\\'t look edible at all and after the disappointment with the hot food, i tossed it. it was covered in white cheese and i could barely see any lettuce. this place delivers, so it\\'s easy to order from here, but implore you....don\\'t! i normally do not like to write a bad review about a restaurant; however, i feel the need to warn people about this place. \\n\\ni went to eat lunch at beach pizza yesterday and the service was good, but the restaurant was dirty and the food was awful. the pizza was not fully cooked and the dough was raw. i was in the phoenix area for baseball spring training and was looking for a unique restarant experience.  as a huge fan of diners, drive-ins, and dives, i could not pass this restaurant up, as i had never had a bad experience at a restaurant that guy fieri had recommended.  i went there with several friends (party of 6, including children).  \\n\\nmy friend and i started with the house salad, which consisted of mixed greens with a very heavy oil vinegrette on it.  the mixed greens were fresh and tasty, but there was so much oil left on my plate after eating the salad, that i used it with the italian bread that was served to the table before the main course.\\n\\nacross the table, we ordered the spaghetti, maccaroni and cheese, and the spaghetti neri (squid ink pasta with oysters, shrimp, and calamari).  i had the spaghetti neri.  i did not try the other dishes, but they looked and smelled delicious.  the spaghetti neri was fairly tastless in terms of the tomato+wine sauce, and was very bland and dissappointing.  the seafood (oysters in particular) were a bit \"fishy\", similar to sushi purchased in a groccery store (sometimes), but not so bad as to preclude eating.  however, the next day, i wish i had not, i had very bad case of food poisening (fever, vomiting) that night and the next day.  i called the restaurant the next day to let them know their seafood might be bad and the manager/owner (rich) told me it couldn\\'t possibly be their food.  since my friend and i ate the same foods that day, except for the spaghetti neri, i am 100% sure it was that dish.\\n\\ni cannot recommend this restaurant.  i am terribly dissappointed at quality of the food, and the owner\\'s attitude, which was brash and bit defensive.  in fact, he did not agree to remove the remaining seafood from the same batch, so that others may not get sick, as well, though he did offer to send a coupon for a free meal on my next trip.  i can only hope that others did not suffer the same fate as i.  if you do dine here, stick to the spaghetti or maccaroni with cheese, and do not order the spaghetti neri! terrible service i called at 455pm for my order i showed up at 5:25pm and my order still wasnt ready they told me it was going to take 10 minutes on the phone..i asked why they told me 10 min and the guy gave me an attitude that it\\'s the busiest time because it\\'s halloween...really? what a liar did not like the food, pancakes not cooked through, counter service for breakfast. this place was horrible!  won\\'t be back what a disappointment. food is way overpriced for its mediocre quality. for the same price, you can do yourself a favor a visit the real little italy in cleveland! with my sister unable to travel due to being in hospice being told we are out of the service area after five years of delivery from the weslake location, this disservice is disappointing. the westlake \"general manager\" is rude and needs to train their implores of setting needs to be set in place. having been told \"if we aren\\'t busy then we would\" doesn\\'t mean anything when most of the time we order on saturdays. having worked in a pizza place, saturdays are the busiest days. \\nthanks for allowing us to go with someone else! we went twice at this place. the first time we had breakfast: i had a cappuccino and a chocolatine and my boyfriend a croissant and a latte. the chocolatine was really disgusting, like dry, the croissant was without any particular taste. and we paid 17$ for this! but we gave them the second chance, we went to grab a coffee and a piece of cake. my hot chocolate was really awful, and my saint honorè was really bad. my bf grabbed another sweet that wasn\\'t really bad, but we paid 20$ and it\\'s too much for 2 pastries and 2 boozes without nothing of special like those. \\nnever again! never ordering from here again. ordered via grubhub and the order never showed up. talked to grubhub 3 times and they said the manager would get back to them yet apparently he never seems to be there?? finally called the store myself to receive my refund and the guy was a complete jerk saying he was too busy to talk to me. do not go here or order from here!!! college cafeteria quality pasta and salads with self service and a surprisingly high price point. pass arrived at 4:00 on a friday, seated right away, but ended up sitting there for 3 hours.\\nordered appetizers and waited and waited, noticed people around us got their food before us and they had come in after us. ordered two small thin crust pizzas and one thick, knowing it takes longer to cook asked for the thin ones right away, one came out, waitress didn\\'t swing by for another 45 minutes,asked where the other thin crust was and she had ordered thick, so they comped it and made the thin one in 20 minutes, very expensive and not good, flavorless sauce, didn\\'t even eat the awful crust, parking is a joke but honestly fired pie is way  better the food was good, service was horrible from both the waiters and the manager! they really need to work on their customer service. we went in today and there was a bitten tomato slice in our salad. the manager didn\\'t believe it came out of the kitchen like that. didn\\'t apologize or anything. the waiter was upset because we told him to remove it from our bill, when we didn\\'t even eat the salad after we found  he bitten tomato. what a shame that their customer service is bad. if i could give a rating about the food, i would. unfortunately we have tried to eat here twice, yet never even saw the menu and walked out. \\nthe 1st visit: we arrived right before 9pm, the staff was obviously trying to close. told us they would seat us, \"if we wanted to dine in\"....i have been in the staffs situation, and was ok with not staying. nobody wants to serve anyone when they are trying to close shop...even though it was an hour before closing hours. \\nthe 2nd visit: we always give 2nd chances to our local businesses. as anthem residents, we love small unfranchised places in our community, so we hoped the 1st visit wasn\\'t a norm. we walked in the entrance, not a human to be seen...so we ventured into the next dining area where we heard voices. one table of about 6 diners and the waiter close by. we stood there for what felt like 5 mins, but was closer to 2, without even a nod from the waiter. the diners looked over, but even they wouldn\\'t speak to us. so guess what, we left. \\nmy husband and i were very sad that your service has been such a disappointment, and we hope you give better service to others. you can\\'t get any worse. first visit today not very busy but clean and nice location. waiter m was not attentive did not say if they had specials or recommend anything. tried straw zucchini all we tasted was the oil it was fried with no flavor was not even hot. then ordered pizza which was good and the rest down hill from there. ordered pasta and meatballs it was lukewarm , asked for shrimp with pasta and was ask how many do you want they are $3.00 a piece.  really so asked for 5 thinking they must be good and  would be at least a medium size guess what they weren\\'t.   i don\\'t mind spending extra if the food is good has flavor and is hot not room temperature.   waiter was just as poor as the food.  will not return! how pretentious can one place be?  this place has outdone even the most pretentious of restaurants to the point that they believe they can do no wrong and treat the customers like dirt.  the manager was especially irksome.  he seemed to believe that his level of hipster coolness allowed him to be above providing solid customer service.  \\n\\nit is possible that this place serves the best food in cleveland or anywhere, but the taste left in my mouth by the manager and staff overpowered my ability to enjoy the food.   if i owned this place i would send the manager elsewhere to \"forage.\" pizza dough was raw.  i called the restaurant, manager gave me the 3rd degree first telling me it should be gummy.  then telling me she would talk to the driver and baker, followed by her telling my to describe the dough and just giving me the third degree.  the dough was raw, the top, the bottom, all the way through in the entire middle 5 inches of the pizza.  it wasn\\'t just gummy on the top layer, it was raw.  i will not be ordering from here again as the manager offered no solution, was condescending and dismissive. the restaurant is really gorgeous. i was so excited for a great meal at this restaurant. \\n\\nwe sat down and ordered our wine and an appetizer (bread knots: more on that later). we spent some time examining the menu. i wasn\\'t thrilled by it -- there were some weird dishes that i wasn\\'t interested in. i\\'m really pretty open to new foods, but lamb\\'s brain (small plate); pig\\'s blood pasta (pasta); and duck offal (pasta) are just too far for me. \\n\\nwe both thought the squid ink pasta would be nice. it was also reasonably priced at $28. i wished i had taken a picture of the menu, because the prices were so strange -- i\\'ve never eaten at a restaurant with such huge disparities in the price points. three of the pastas were in the $20 range, and then the next one up was, i think, $40, and then a $60. for pasta. \\n\\nthe entrees were the same. two fish dishes at around $30 and then a huge jump up to the $60 and $80 territories. \\n\\nanyway, we thought we\\'d get the squid ink pasta. so when the server came back, that\\'s what we ordered. but she told us they were out of that. \\n\\ni\\'ve been to many restaurants. i\\'ve never in my life had the server not tell me when they were out of a main dish until the moment i ordered. usually, that\\'s the kind of thing you tell a patron when you hand them the menu.\\n\\n\"welcome to buca, here\\'s your menu. just to let you know, we\\'re out of the squid ink pasta tonight. i\\'m so sorry. take a look and let me know if you have any questions.\"\\n\\nso we\\'d been there for 30 minutes, we were getting quite hungry, we had already ordered wine and an appetizer (so we were already in $50), and then you tell us we can\\'t get the dish we wanted?\\n\\nthe server said the next pasta dish on the menu (the one that was twice the price) was also very good and similar to the pasta dish we couldn\\'t order. yeah, no thanks.\\n\\nit\\'s just such a bizarre incident. i\\'ve never done this in my life. we paid our $50 for wine and appetizers (which were shockingly hard bits of bread swimming in a pool of salt and olive oil, but mostly salt) and left the restaurant. extremely disappointed. my wife and i used to like coming here for happy hour. recently we just had a baby girl. we figured out quick that it isn\\'t easy to get out to eat. we decided to go to their happy hour to get out of the house with our baby but was unfortunately offput because they wouldn\\'t serve us because of our baby. i can understand the scene isn\\'t good for our baby, so i asked if we could sit in the dining room, and maybe they could still honor the happy hour. they refused and said that they couldn\\'t. while waiting for my wife to enter the restuarunt after parking i was asked multiple times if i needed help and asked them all if they could honor happy hour, and they all said no. no one went to ask a manager or anything. just no. really upsetting after we spent so much energy and time to drive there for their food. this just shows that they don\\'t care about their customers. wonder what else they do or refuse to do when it comes to their food service. i\\'ll never go back. there food isn\\'t good enough for me to pay for a sitter anyway. i will say that we decided to go to spotted donkey on scottsdale and carefree and they honored there happy hour for us with our baby in the dining room. better place, better food, better people at spotted donkey. i\\'ve been coming to this place for awhile now and this last experience has been so awful i am never coming back!!!!\\ni made a reservation for my husbands birthday for 12 people on a weds night in the bar area. we arrived to find out that they lost our reservation and we\\'re told in a condescending manner that, \"we don\\'t take bar reservations\".  we explained that we talked to kevin and he double checked that the our reservation in the bar would be just fine. when i told manger/owner this, instead of apologizing and trying to rectify the situation, he acted as if we were out of line or lying about our reservation.  so then they shoved some tables awkwardly together and never said sorry or that they were going to take care of us in any way.  i\\'m not sure why we stayed but we did, we were trying to have a good time for his birthday.. when the \"incompetently obnoxious\" server finally came over to get our drink/food order ,it was at least 5-10 mins. she took our order  and got everyone except myself.  she never asked me again if i was okay or if i was eating anything.  long story short, it took forever and we waiting about 30 mins for our checks.. speaking of split checks... two couples in our group asked for separate checks because they had to leave early.  that wasn\\'t a problem for them to get separate checks but when we asked for our checks to be split, she dropped off one check and told us to circle what we had!  we did so and of course she screwed it all up.  we also had a $25 gift card that surprisingly didn\\'t work. they took the card and comped our bill. but really we paid $25 because they be we gave us a new gift card, (not like i\\'d ever come back).   don\\'t waste your time here!!!! the owner could give a shit about giving good service or making customers feel wanted. so sad. a beautiful afternoon to enjoy this lovely view and cool breeze ..... that\\'s where the good review ends.  approximately a dozen guests in the entire restaurant ..... we waited close to an hour for a lunch that never arrived. the waitress kept apologizing and brought complimentary chips but there comes a point of no return and our gut feeling was to get up and leave. after this long of a wait for a sandwich you have to wonder what could possibly be going on in that kitchen ??  and we do not want to know. very dissapointed! went with a group of six people on a friday night and the bartender came over to our table and let us know that she was one of only a few people in and that it would be difficult to wait on us. i felt like we inconvenienced her for coming in. she also made sure to ask us not to move our seats so she would not screw up our order. however our food was terrible (and cold) and wrong drinks came to our table and we were charged for them. at the point i wanted to get out of the hipster, rude bar that i paid the tab anyways. first and last trip for me and my friends. i would give this parti cici\\'s a -10 if it were possible. i ordered a specialty personal pan pizza which first of all took over 40 minutes for them to get it out to me. not to mention, they were not crowded. when it got to me, the pizza dough was still raw, and it was not what i had ordered. the pizza bar was very empty. i am a cici\\'s pizza professional. i have been eating at cici\\'s for over 20 years. my kids have had several birthday parties at cici\\'s. i lived in virginia for many years, where the cici\\'s are much different and much better. i will never ever go to another cici\\'s pizza in las vegas. this is not my first horrible experience with this particular restaurant. the management didn\\'t seem to have a care in the world when i brought these problems to their attention. have been to this location many times before, but has gotten worse. the place was freezing cold on a night when it was not even warm outside. the music is overwhelmingly too loud-so much so, that the staff could never hear us across the glass! the customers cannot hear the staff either. also, the blond female staff member at the first station hardly seemed like she knew what she was doing.\\nit would be helpful to have the ingredients labeled so we would not have to yell across the glass continuously asking what everything was. dissapointed!! bland food no flavour , seems rushed to make and probably pre-made/ frozen\\nspaggetti was tastless, disliked the lemon chicken , eggplant parm was worse then the one i make at home  \\nnot a true authentic italian restaurant \\nwill not be coming or ordering again i loved this place but i just came here for lunch and i just literally had the worst experience ever with an unfamiliar waiter,  he had absolutely no motivation while taking our order and he was slow and seemed to be out of it. he took an unnecessarily long time with every interaction with us and we were finally able to place our order nearly 30 minutes after arriving. my friend ordered a salad and when it arrived it took over 10 minutes to get a fork  - i believe they wanted him ti eat it with his fingers. \\n\\nunless management finds some new non-drug addict employees i do not think i will be returning. this place is gross. the food is gross, along with the decor & especially the carpet. i wouldn\\'t feed my dog scraps from this place. have no problem with the pizza, or the service. the owner is a major turn off. he planted his large self at our table and proceeded to wax on about himself for most\\nof the meal, his real estate deals, his money, blah blah. never once asked any\\nthing about us, or, even how the food was. guy is a loser. so i had to share my experience about this place. the place is called carmella\\'s pizza grill in charlotte, nc located on south tryon street. i came here for lunch today like i normally do as a frequent customer and ordered a philly cheesesteak... i noticed one of the hispanic females in the back making other people\\'s food with her bare hands and not stopping to wash them not one time. she then proceeded to grab the raw steak meat for my sandwich with no gloves on her hands and place it on the grill then grabbed my bread with her hands and sliced it... i was absolutely disgusted as she put my pickle in the box... loaded my sandwich with cheese and all and not once washing her hands or putting on gloves! very unsanitary!!! i told them i didn\\'t want the sandwich and another person decided made me a new sandwich with gloves!!! i will not be going back to this place... i cannot believe they touch people\\'s food with no gloves and when the cashier told the lady to put on gloves she argued with her and got an attitude and still didn\\'t put on gloves and proceeded to touch other people\\'s food!!! as well i never got an apology!!! very rude and disgusting experience!!! staff is snooty , coffee is horrible , entrance is right by where you order.   i generally give a place a few times before writing a review, and i have visited about 4 times . each time it was the same experience, horrible..  hopefully they will educate their staff on making customers feel welcome instead of rushing people to make an order. a little disappointed with this restaurant. we called ahead of time to confirm reservations and vegan friendly meals. when we arrive the waitress had no idea if they even served vegan and gluten free options. she basically blew us off and since my mom has celiac it was pertinent we had celiac friendly meals. the chef has posted all over social media that this place is friendly. the end of it all we left very disappointed. ordered a lunch special.  2 slices and a soda.\\ntook 20 minutes to receive the absolute worst pizza i\\'ve ever had.  the cheese was either fake or really old and the sauce was really watery.  the place looked really nice but the food was terrible and took a really long time. \\n\\nsave your time and money and go somewhere else. \\n\\nyuck. first, they came for the calamari, but i did not say anything because they were out of calamari. then they came for the zucchini, and again i remained silent, as they were out of zucchini also. it was 6 pm on friday.\\n\\ni write this review ironically as this place will no longer be in business by the time anyone reads this.\\n\\nget the chicken parmigiana. enjoy your one shriveled piece of chicken breast. it\\'s extra good because they don\\'t bother with that pesky mozzarella cheese on top, which is always a bummer. please, pay $19 for ravioli from the freezer. the mussels? better get two orders because there are about 6 mussels per order.\\n\\nthe owners were sitting right next to us and were sure to get us our check before offering dessert because we dare to be unimpressed with their garbage. i\\'d say don\\'t bother coming, but it won\\'t be here if you try. laughable that anyone would rate this place 5 stars. in the chicagoland area rosati\\'s is right up there with pizza hut, but they have the audacity to be twice the price. a pizza from rosati\\'s is only edible after 12-15 blue moons. i don\\'t want to know what you people rated papa johns... food was medico at best, and the service was terrible. sat for 20mins with no drink refills, and the meatballs taste like they were baked in the morning then microwaved for the lunch crowd. not worth it... honestly, i feel conflicted making this review because in the past, my experiences at nypd pizza have been standard.  tonight, however, their food was disturbingly poor; so much so, that i feel compelled to write this review after avoiding reviews for years.  i ordered the greek salad because it sounded great, but what i received should not have been served, period, let alone slapped with the label \"greek.\"  it was mixed greens, mostly iceberg lettuce, that was at the end of its life.  nearly every leaf was brown around the edges or simply inedible.  whatever.  the worst part were the elements of the salad that presumably made it \"greek\" -- kalamata olives, cucumbers, bell peppers, feta cheese, and onion.  i don\\'t even feel particularly comfortable making those terms plural because what i received was literally 2 or 3 of the ingredients each in a large salad.  3 olives.  3 cucumber slices, which were bitter, by the way, and had that soap taste.  i found only 1 slice of bell pepper.  one.  i won\\'t blame the restaurant for this (although i should), but the feta was tasteless.  how could (feta) cheese be bland?!  i didn\\'t try the onions, but that was the most abundant item on the list.  five whole slices of red onion!  hit the jackpot!  \\n\\neither stop selling this horrendous excuse for a salad, or make it with ingredients that are fresh and ripe.  i would ask for y\\'all to include more than 1-3 of each ingredient, but that seems like a rather grandiose request when providing the paying customer with edible food is not a given.  i\\'ve never been this angry about a salad -- congrats, nypd pizza! this place is over priced and they nickel & dime you. although their wings were good, and the quality was what i\\'d expect--- it is not worth the money. there is far too much competition to put up with this. based on the fact we were 1 of only 3 couples eating there--i\\'d say others are catching on and taking their business else where. if upper crust want to stick around another year, i\\'d suggest lowering their pricing/profits. we will not be going back unless the prices are dropped. our server was attentive and courteous. the atmosphere is very italian and cute decor. the food, however, was very disappointing. i order the special, lamb.  it was extremely over cooked and tough. it didn\\'t taste like lamb either! panko-crusted. no flavour whatsoever. served with very plain steamed vegetables. my brother ordered the risotto. extremely bland. my father ordered the firecracked seafood pasta. terrible oily and lacking taste. my mother ordered the seafood linguini. again, very bland. we ordered the zucchini fries, calamari and mushroom masala for our appetizers. all very disappointing. the bread served with oil and vinager was the best part of the meal. worse customer service ever! my boyfriend and i were even staring at the girl working there wondering at which point she would smile. everyone was just rude and the pizza was absolutely terrible. it was slimy because of the grease and the dough was undercooked. seriously, don\\'t waste your money. the pizza was absolutely rancid. i live in a place riddled with horrible 99 cent pizza places which are so bad, a pita with ketchup and government cheese would be comparable. this is worse than that. the bread sticks were ... edible, the hotwings were about as good as dominos (when they feel like being stingy with the sauce), but the onion rings were garbage. probably frozen, definitely processed, and tasted like cold mashed potatoes that just got a divorce. if this is the only place open and you\\'re hungry late at night, drink some water and have a good breakfast the next day. waited too long for my pizza to arrive and manager was no help, only to offer 25% off in the future. if you want to wait 2.5 hours for your order after being told it would only take an hour, then this is your place. i got a cheese pizza and wings and the pizza was disgusting. it tasted and looked like cheddar cheese on the pizza and tasted like cheesy sodium. it was horrific. the wings were really good, but i\\'d never order from here again. terrible terrible pizza. my best friend and i were doing a lot of running around and needed to grab a quick lunch so we came here. we heard they were great for the meatballs and garlic bread. \\n\\nthe garlic bread was in the shape of a knot and they where huge and very garlicky. they tasted really good but  a bit too much garlic. \\n\\nthe meatballs honestly weren\\'t the greatest and they where overly used with garlic!\\n\\nthe pizza was just a normal brick oven pizza nothing special at all. \\n\\na little while latter man was i sick. i think it\\'s way too much garlic used in the food. my friend and i were vomiting from the food. it was so bad. i\\'ve had eventful experiences that weren\\'t as bad as my experience at sambuca\\'s on church. \\nas the name suggests i was super excited to try their winterlicious lunch to the extent that i made reservations and couldn\\'t wait for a much awaited friday lunch.\\nupon reaching the restaurant we were greeted by a host and was told that my name was not on the list which means they didn\\'t enter my reservation details.\\nfurthermore i was told that i\\'d have to wait for another 50 mins or so for a table, to which i decided to do a take out instead.\\nso i ordered a soup, seafood risotto and tiramisu to go. \\nmy friend ordered a seafood salad. \\nwe realized that a take out shouldn\\'t take that long.\\nafter a good amount of time our orders arrived and in spite of giving separate orders they added everything in one bag which was still ok. so when we went aside to segregate \\nour orders we noticed our dessert and plastic cutlery were missing. that\\'s not the end of it. when the time came to pay for our bills they did not charge us separately and put everything on one tab and were super busy to amend it .\\ni have dined at numerous restaurants during rush hours and never have i came across such an experience so appalling that it failed to match toronto standards. this place is the worst. their customer service was shotty and was acting aggressive when asked to repeat an order. there call service sucks and is assholes fuck them they suck food and atmosphere seem fine, but lack of pigeon control is extremely alarming. watched half a dozen pigeons today devour a customer\\'s plate after they left. pigeon carry many diseases, and the contact that they have the plates and utensils is a pathogen health risk. waiters did not seem concerned and were slow to collect plates. my wife had a bad stomach ache later that night that may or may not be attributed to food born illness. i was disappointed with the chain\\'s lack of high standards and may not eat there again. also their back of the house seemed messy and sanitation buckets where on top of the food preparation tables, another cross contamination risk between floor and food prep surface. horrible please if your buying pizza on a budget just settle for lil ceasers. the pizza is horrible here the wings are greasy as hell. and the customer service sucks!!!!!!!!! i ordered a pizza online 7:40ish it said it will arrive in a hour....... ok and hour goes by i call check on it someone nonchalantly picks up and says it\\'ll be here soon here comes 9 at this point my kids haven\\'t ate dinner there sleepy avatars i don\\'t even want it anymore so i call to get a refund. in the middle of me talking to them they hang up. i call back they hang up. then they tell me you have to go to the store to get a refund. then 9:50 pizza hut calls in in the lobby. we go ahead and get it anyways the pizza is cold ass hell the wings are greasy like they were never drained just thrown directly in to the bowl. just horrible don\\'t waste your time or money. and this isn\\'t the first time they took over an hour to deliver  but this will be the last time! ordered delivery and they forgot for two hours. then proceeded to give me my food cold. i\\'ve been to this location when i was younger, but now a days, most east side mario\\'s seems lifeless.. the decor is out dated, and the picture frames dusty.. as for the food,i got the goat cheese chicken. the chicken was small & dry, the whole plate was filled with dried veggies also.. mom some sort of chicken rose linguini that was mediocre as well.. 1 star for service & salad though :) servers unable to articulate specials. and a little bitchy, to say the least. don\\'t go here ever. very late review. we first visited for breakfast and enjoyed the deviled eggs, the waffle was a weird texture, but we let it slide. in october 2017, we came for dinner and did the 9ish course chefs menu. the timing of the food was off...first three dishes came out too fast, then we waited about 45 minutes for the next course. nothing was remarkable, except for the risotto. it is possibly the worst thing i\\'ve ever had. how can rosetta be both gummy and hard at the same time? another couple who appeared to be doing the tasting menu, left about 1/2 way through. luckily, we had gone to la albatross earlier for a pre-dinner drink and escargot. that was the highlight of the night. ordered pizza , mozzarella sticks and breadsticks.  delivery took over an hour and then they gave me meatballs instead of mozzarella sticks. not similar at all. if crappy service and extra salty chicken piccata is your recipe for success, then this is the place for you! 1 hour to get our main dish with only a salad app.  oh, and the caprese sucked. first off, let me preface this with us having read the yelp reviews, so we expected to wait for our food.  we had a $30 groupon discount for this establishment, so we figured it would make a good date night.  it turned out that this was the worst experience we have ever had at a restaurant.\\n\\nthe place was busy, a good sign.  we are told that it would be about 15 minutes to get seated.  no worries.  there is a bar and a lounge (a couch, pool table, and 3 arcade games).  there is not any real seating and it is uncomfortably warm in the waiting area.  \\n\\nwe finally get seated, look over the menu, and then order.  first off, we order an appetizer, pasta, a pizza, and i also order a beer.  our waitress says they do not have that beer.  not as in they ran out, but as in they do not stock it.  we show her the menu and she asks another waitress before she accepts it an takes down the order.  we get glasses of water.\\n\\nand we wait... and wait... and wait...\\n\\nmaybe 30 minutes later, my beer is finally served.  soon after, the appetizer shows up.  okay, so they are busy.  definitely short staffed; maybe some of their staff called out.  but now, we are at the head of the queue and they are preparing our food... or so we hoped.\\n\\nand we wait... and wait... and wait...\\n\\nour bruschetta is long gone, our water is nearly empty, and i am trying to make my beer last.  all of our talk between my girlfriend and i has petered out, we have looked around at all of the other patrons, and have succumbed to staring at the ceiling.  my bowl of pasta arrives.  as i am a gentleman, i do not start eating and wait for my girlfriend\\'s pizza to arrive.\\n\\nand we wait... and wait... and wait...\\n\\nmost restaurants would question when one single-serving plate is delivered, and there are two people sitting at the table.  they would inquire if you are waiting for any more food.  at this point, we are gave up on a good dinner and are just waiting to see how long until they notice that they messed up.  the romantic atmosphere is gone.  she begs me to eat my food before it gets cold.  i try to give her some, but she only take a few bites.  i begin to eat my pasta, hoping that at any moment her food would be delivered.\\n\\nand we wait... and wait... and wait...\\n\\ni am over half way done with my plate before the waitress comes over to ask me how my food was, when she realizes something is wrong and asks my girlfriend if she is waiting on anything.  we inform her that we are still waiting on a pizza.  the waitress leaves our table to go back and check on it.  she soon returns and apologizes because she forgot to put in the order for the pizza, but she says she will comp the pizza.  okay... mea culpa.  she says in exact terms, that it will be out in 8 minutes.  we wait eight minutes...\\n\\nand we wait... and wait... and wait...\\n\\ni am done with my pasta.  all of our drinks are bone dry.  we tell our waitress that she should put the pizza in a to-go box.  she tells us that it will be out in just a few minutes.  she asks us about how we want to use our $60 groupon or save it for next time.  we inform her that it was only a $30 groupon.  we could have gone with it and got an extra $30 worth of free food, but it was not worth it.  we already said how we are never going to come back and there is no way we were going to wait any longer for more food to be prepared and served.  so at this point, we know between the groupon and the comp, our bill would be basically nothing.\\n\\nand we wait... and wait... and wait...\\n\\nat this time, there are very few people still eating in the restaurant.  another waitress comes over and asks us if we wanted refills, we decline because we know it will take an eternity and we just cannot wait to leave.  i am biting my tongue trying not to explode as my girlfriend praises me for not making a scene.  i put my head in my hands.\\n\\nand we wait... and wait... and wait...\\n\\nafter a time of 8 minutes plus 30, the hostess who is now cleaning tables approaches us and asks us if everything is okay.  i ask her to go please check on the status of our pizza.  she says that is it being boxed and will be right out.  almost immediately, the pizza is brought out.  that makes me think that it was sitting and waiting to be brought out... for who knows how long.  \\n\\nwe are presented with a bill for $1.08.  seriously... we wait for over one and a half hours for some bread with tomatoes, a bowl of pasta, and a pizza, and then you have the audacity to not comp the remaining dollar?!?  \\n\\nwe leave the restaurant.  the only thing i want to do is run; praying that the food does not get me sick. don\\'t order the fried zucchini slices, you can\\'t taste the zucchini at all, it is basically just eating panko. the overall concept is great. authentic italian pizza in montreal, but sadly it needs a lot of work. the service was that of a brand new staff with minimal to no training. the wine service was some of the worst i\\'ve ever seen,(and i am no pro myself). forgotten orders and the lack to correct situations where very apparent. \\n\\nthe staff needs to be retrained and needs a leader. good luck parking here and don\\'t park at restaurants next door...you\\'ll be towed. interesting that with a full parking lot the place was half empty once i got in. long wait for average pizza..staff need training. basically all that reminded me of the giordano\\'s i used to eat at on van buren was the sign out front. thumbs down...won\\'t be back. i prefer spinatos this has nothing to do with italian food.  are you a market or a restaurant?  stick to market.  the place was empty on a saturday night, save for one couple who came in after us.  $16 for a cocktail???  seriously???  \\n\\nif your menu says there is bechamel on the lasagna, there should be bechamel on the lasagna- not coagulated ricotta.  and seriously, can you not do better than a reheated slice of lasagna from your market deli counter?  \\n\\nthere was nothing authentic or good about this place.  it\\'s pretentious, the waitresses obnoxious (don\\'t roll your eyes at me when i happen to have a negative opinion about something) and the food sub par.  avoid this place at all cost- there are so many better options for a dinner in montreal.  \\n\\ncrap on a plate. listen.  casey is on my last nerve.  the taco pizza is so nasty.  you can order pizza for delivery- if you are that sad of a person- but the delivery drivers are like deadbeat dads.  they rarely show up when they say they will, if they do show up the are usually over an hour late, they ask for money for something stupid- like their taco pizza-yuck. extremely rude employees. did not want to serve me. they were all talking huddled in a group. unprofessional. i ask for tomato sauce and they told me to buy dipping sauce. that it was illegal to give me tomato sauce for my pizza??? what the heck!! the girl that works has such an attitude. the whole staff in this place unprofessional and extremely rude. will not be returning and will not buy pizza pizza. i will not spend my money on poor managed franchise! wow this is the last time i don\\'t check yelp on a restaurant. do not order from this place if you are in a hotel.  the delivery driver, rather than go to our room, called. i miss the call and called him back repeatedly to no avail. he took it upon himself to sell my order to someone else. then berate me on the phone for not picking up when he called.  when i called the store they did apologized but offered no comps to offset the experience.  based upon the other reviews of the food perhaps they did me a favor by not delivering.  ugh. don\\'t use this place. never going back! the server took forever to come over and when she did was not paying attention and obviously had her mind somewhere else. she had asked to repeat my  drink order twice and my dinner order three times. when the food did eventually come out it looked like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for awhile. the food was mediocre at best. the only thing that was even edible was the salad. so needless to say i will never eat at an olive garden again. ignored my call for over 20 minutes.  hung up on after 1st 10min and never got to speak to anyone. immediately called back and got stuck on hold all the way to closing time (11pm sunday night) and hung up on again.\\n\\ni get it. its late and you want to get home. answer your phone then and tell folks you aren\\'t taking anymore carry out orders or adjust your vmail greeting to say the kitchen isn\\'t taking anymore orders.\\n\\nwill never order from this location again was walking by with my dogs and wanted to have a bite. their terrasse, being on the sidewalk as it is, seemed a reasonable spot for us to stop. but the dude we asked a table for didn\\'t waste time in rudely telling us he wouldn\\'t set us with our dogs. rude fat lady refused to let us try more than 3 testers though we buy 3scoops, no policy..., just said sorry \"you had enough and \"cherry is cherry okay\". like...okay are those little spoons expensive or something?... will not go back. went there once and the food was ok. husband thought it was terrible and swore he wouldn\\'t go again. i convinced him to try it on another occasion. he agreed. we sat outside and it was cold so they put the heater on for us, and we were happy. \\nsoon a table of 6 arrived who were a bit older than us (& must\\'ve appeared to have fatter pockets) because the owner\\'s wife hurried over, took our heater and brought it to the new table. the new table was embarrassed because they hadn\\'t mentioned they were cold and it was obvious that i was cozied up to the heater. they kinda made faces as if to say,  \"we\\'re sorry,\" shrugging their shoulders, etc. no one said anything; it was just one of those things that was astoundingly awkward to everyone watching. soon after, they were sweating and taking off their jackets. after all, they\\'d never asked for a heater. i wouldn\\'t have been surprised if the woman had taken the bread off of our table next, the way she was spastically arranging for this potentially lucrative table. \\nwe never reclaimed our heater, we just finished up and got outta there, our decision never to return final. what on earth was i thinking? \\n\\ni know rascal house pizza is terrible-- weird, sweet crust reminiscent of bisquick, sweet sauce, tasteless toppings.  it was one of three places to eat on euclid whilst i was taking my bar review at csu (not as fun as it sounds-- bar exam review, not a review of bars).  the other two were an arby\\'s and a scary greasy spoon.  so i ended up having at rascal house more times than i care to count.  imagine having to study for the most important test of your life and having to eat bad pizza along with it.  the horror.  the horror.\\n\\ni\\'ve had it since then, because downtown firms always seem to order it for working lunches.  it has not improved.\\n\\nso, here i am, back at csu to take a few classes.  what to have for lunch.  i\\'m pretty sick of subway.  nothing at the school food service looks good today.  what to get?  a salad.  how hard can a salad be?  surely rascal house has a simple, tasty salad.  most  pizza places do.\\n\\nswamp water.  that\\'s what it tasted like.  the lettuce bore the unmistakeable taste of pre-cut, bagged lettuce that had been siting in the cooler for a while until someone opend it and dumped it into a container without washing it.  (i worked at a few dives to put myself through undergrad.  i know how that works.)  the carrot shreds were completly dry and had absorbed whatever scary odors were going around the cooler.  the turkey and ham were both of the ultra processed, parts-is-parts variety. there was about a tablespoon of cheese and two tiny slices of hard boiled egg.  sad.\\n\\nthen, i had to eat it whilst listening to really bad, really loud 1980s top 40.   no cure, no depeche mode.  1980s hambone music.\\n\\ni\\'m going out to find an insulated lunch bag. the guy that took our order was outside with girlfriend both of which had sweet green hair... she brought the dog inside... then he took our order with his disgusting mustache and beard and then made our sandwiches... it was disgusting to watch! please skip this location!! now minimum wage is 10$ an hour hire someone good???? clean cut like inn and out burger?? i was going to order from this place for delivery to my hotel but found out they charge you $3.50 for a delivery charge and $2.00 if you want to use a credit card. so my $9.00 spaghetti turned into almost 17 bucks. .that\\'s horrible.  and they don\\'t give you a break down so that you know you\\'re getting ripped off. wish i could give this place zeroooo stars\\n\\n\\nstaying in a hotel and was suckered in to buying the 2 for $15.99 pizza anyway...terrible choice... one of the pizzas has nooo chicken on it..the ingredients and sparse... just an effin waste...ohhj and they wouldn\\'t delivery to the room..i had to come to the lobby to pick it up..wish they would have told me ahead of time.. we thought we had great seats since they were dead center but the blasted railings are installed so high that they obstruct the view of the screen. also, no ushers come in during the show so you\\'re often stuck with some little terror that\\'s hopped up on slushies running around and ruining the movie for everyone except his own parents, who are invariably completely blind and deaf when it comes to their own offspring. i\\'ve had my last trip to this daycare center/ theatre. i finally got around to eating at l\\'académie this friday. the restaurant gives off this air of zen grandeur and european opulence at the same time while serving a fusion of italian and french fusion cuisine. what it is really is a lot of pretentiousness and posturing, form over function, appeal over taste.\\n\\nto begin with i couldn\\'t believe the menu or more to the point how 30 years ago it was. what self-respecting fine dining institution with any sense of modernity still serves coquille st-jacques, escargot with garlic butter and parmesan fondue as entrée? really? in 2008? tortellini cardinal is not fine dining it\\'s now been reduced to cafeteria food. all good plates when well prepared, but preparations that are passé and no longer original.\\n\\ni started with the insalata italiana or italian salad.\\nlovely greens, very fresh and some cherry tomatoes that tasted just awful and sticks of parmesan regiano with a nice balsamic vinaigrette. most restaurants drown their salads in vinaigrette, l\\'académie seems to fear this very same thing by not putting enough dressing on the salad and the salad tasted dry.\\n\\nthen as my primo piatto, or plat de resistance\\ni went for the filet mignon with a port reduction. i\\'m just a sucker for steak. it was served with potatoes that had been fried whole and some veggies. the only thing that was remotely good was the port reduction. ok maybe the corn cob which tasted a bit funny because it was obviously not from québec soil.\\n\\nthe broccoli bouquet was undercooked and completely tastless. the carrot was also seriously undercooked. there\\'s a difference between al dente and undercooked; a chef should know such a simple difference.\\n\\nthe potatoes... how can a chef screw up a staple like potatoes? we all eat potatoes, we can expect better than fried whole potatoes that have absolutely no seasoning or taste, are dry and crunchy; just so wrong.\\n\\nlast but no least on the hit list, the filet mignon. now correct me if i\\'m wrong because i\\'m no steak expert but i eat enough steak in steakhouses and consider myself a bit of a connoisseur, but filet mignon shouldn\\'t be marbled with fat and nerving right? well i had to chainsaw this filet mignon and after three bites i was done.\\n\\nthat was it. three bites of my steak and one half of a potato and i couldn\\'t eat anymore. i was beyond disappointed. i knew i wasn\\'t stepping into a high end restaurant, but it does hold up a promise of fine dining. this was ridiculous, flavourless and pretty much revolting.\\n\\ndesert... there was no desert;\\ni couldn\\'t take any more disappointment this evening. why is it restaurants or chefs can\\'t prepare simple things like a steak? this is montreal, a world renowned steak town and this supposedly fine dinning restaurant can\\'t prepare a decent steak? when i try out new restaurants i go for the simple items on the menu, because that\\'s the true test of a chef. if i go to an italian restaurant and i order the ever classic and simple alfredo and i can taste that it comes from a starch filled envelope, when it\\'s quite possibly the easiest sauce to prepare, i will never set foot in that restaurant again; as i will do with l\\'académie.\\n\\na generous 1 outta 5. pizza and lasagna just showed up, 30 minutes after the delivery time they quoted (which was 45-60 minutes).  pizza is cold, might as well have been made yesterday.  salad is fine.  lasagna is ok tasting, warm-ish temperature.  garlic bread is cold.  we understand friday nights get busy for pizza places, but reflect that in your quote time.  or don\\'t quote anything at all. and you better be damn sure you send out hot food.  we could have had frozen better than this.  judging by appearance only, it\\'s probably pretty good when it\\'s hot and fresh but we wouldn\\'t know that via their delivery.  this was our first call, definitely won\\'t try them again.  woman who answered the phone was rude and unhelpful when we called to check on the status of our order.  go elsewhere! the pizza here is really really bad. my boyfriend and i came with a group of 8 people. one person in our group has a gluten-free diet, and with there being such limited gluten-free options for pizza restaurants we were looking forward to trying mark rich\\'s. unfortunately, i doubt we\\'d ever go back.\\n\\neach person ordered a different pizza. jayse and i shared, ordering a large cheese with tomatoes and half artichoke. the crust could best be described as a tasteless, soggy cardboard, and the toppings on each pizza were sparse. for the artichokes on ours, there was only individual artichoke leaves (no actual heart pieces) spread around the pizza very sparingly. you couldn\\'t even taste them. the food was paired with poor service from our server, making for a very disappointing meal. we wouldn\\'t recommend this place. there\\'s much better pizza options here in town at similar prices. will never order from here again! their medium pizza is the size of a dijorno but w thin crust! totally overpriced and not worth the money! i\\'m from ny, and we eat real pizza w real sized slices!!!  the website pics are a farce. went there only bc it was recommended by a friend. won\\'t listen to her ever again! this the worst type of place.... i\\'ve eaten here about 4 or 5 times now and it is never the same. idk if they have no recipes or they never buy their stuff at the same place but it always is different. today we got the same as we always do,  large 1/2 mushrooms 1/2 sausage and it was 10x better than last time. whatever they did this time they need to do it again. my wife and i went here expecting good things.  the reviews on yelp were high.  we walked in the front door and the bar tender and the manager just stare at us like, \"what do you want?\"  we were confused--trying to to figure out if we were supposed to seat ourselves or be seated.  finally a waitress tells us we can sit wherever we want.  we sit outside and are given menus and water.  as we are looking over the menu the aroma from the herb and tea house next door  becomes stronger and stronger.  we decide to move inside--no problem.  our waitress was friendly and suggested the calamari or eggplant appetizer--we go with the fried calamari.  the calamari comes back in a timely matter and looks ok.  we tasted it and it was disgusting.  i\\'ve never had calamari fried this way...it was fried in the same type of manner as fried chicken and it had a dirty oil taste.  the fried part was light and crispy but the after taste was like burnt oil.  we told the waitress and swapped it out for the grilled calamari.  the grilled was definitely better but very chewy.  the only good thing about it was the sauce. \\n i ordered the margarita pizza and my wife ordered the chicken panini.  my pizza was pretty good.  the center of the pizza was pretty soggy but the sauce and cheese were a 6 or 7 out of 10--i\\'ll take it.  my wife took one bite of her panini and thought it was gross.  i thought she was over reacting so i tried a bite.  it wasn\\'t good at all--the chicken was dry, the bread too hard, and the broccolini bitter (which the owner said is how it\\'s supposed to be).  \\nat this point we were really disappointed.  it\\'s one of the worst feelings going into a restaurant hungry and looking forward to a nice meal and being disappointed and leaving hungry. \\nthe owner took the panini and fried calamari off the ticket and apologized.  the apology didn\\'t seem very heart felt--seemed more annoyed.  some people have had good experiences here but i will never go back.  if you do go--don\\'t get the calamari or the chicken panini--and expect the pizza\\'s crust to be soggy in the middle. well i asked for extra cook time on my wings, and seems like i got laughed at when told her mother the order, then they placed my pizza with my friends pizza which was very unacceptable; because i don\\'t eat pork for one! then they both had the nerve to tell me my pizza didn\\'t touch hers. first of all how do you know if we came in the same car???? plus who does that without asking???? and she ordered hot wings which looked like my soggy ass mild wings. no wonder why the place is  dead!  stumpy\\'s off northern and 12th st has great  pizza!!!! was recommended by a friend who frequents this place. went in with my family no one was there to seat us, place was almost empty so we just grabbed a table. after 5 minutes of not seeing a server we left. dissapointed, called manager \"scott\" to let him know, sounded like he just woke up. good service but i\\'m rating it with a one star because the food was not very good, especially for the price $$. for appetizers i ordered some sausages, cold in the middle, they brought me another order of them but they just weren\\'t good, very dry. and i got fried zucchini, no bueno either. for my entree i got chicken parm which wasn\\'t bad but like i said too $$, you could go to olive garden and be more satisfied. oh! their bread was good so the pizza may be on point but i didn\\'t try? well the service was average. the atmosphere was kind of confusing. it was as if the place didn\\'t have an identity. they wanted to be classy, but they sold pizza. it was also too wide open, like a college hangout. waaay too expensive for college students. i didn\\'t particularly care about the burnt crust on the pizza either. the pics in the restrooms, waaay too raunchy for kids! dirtiest og i have ever seen, sloppy service and nobody helped. like there was no manager there this place is closed. (sorry for putting this in a review, but i cannot find the \"report closed\" button on yelp. thought this was a decent place to eat in wisconsin, when we took my girlfriends 92 year grandmother here and they would not even turn the heat on for her when it was 60 degrees in the restaurant. the worst part was when we arrived i used the restroom to and saw one of the cooks coming out of the stall after taking a shit, only to see him not wash his hands and head right for the door. absolutely disgusting! i will never be back and i hope the next visit they get is from the health department. if there was less then one star that\\'s what this place would get.... it\\'s horrible don\\'t waste your time or money!! ordered the white pizza its was very very salty. we each had one piece and tossed the rest. jalapeño were okay we ate those. then we got a slice of tiramisu it was frozen! and got the balalaika and it was stale. it was the worse meal i have ever bought!! i will say the delivery drive was very nice. 40$ not well spent!! terrible service, just terrible.  every time.  isn\\'t the definition of insanity doing the same thing over and over again, expecting different results?  shame on me.\\n\\nmost recently, i called pizza hut because i\\'m avoiding papa johns for political reasons.  they told me that they needed to \"confirm that i had given them the correct telephone number.\"  first of all, in this day and age, what business doesn\\'t have caller id!?!  in any event, i confirmed that, in fact, she had my correct phone number.  astonishingly, she said she needed to call me back to \"further confirm.\"  as if that\\'s not idiotic enough to require two phone calls to order a pizza, she told me, \"if i don\\'t call you back in 5 minutes, you need to call us back or else we\\'ll cancel your order.\"  yeah, um, okay.  i\\'m going to sit by my phone with bated breath for five minutes, and if you don\\'t call back, i\\'m going to call you back.  so i can have the privilege of eating your semi-disgusting, totally unhealthy pizza.  no thank you.  you can go ahead and just cancel it right now.  i\\'m pretty sick of domino\\'s, but i\\'ve had far better service from them. \\n\\noh, and by the way...if you order online to avoid the ridonkulousness, the estimated time is merely \"an estimate\" that you need to call and confirm with the store.  and so if their online \"estimate\" is, say, 45 minutes off, well that\\'s your problem, buddy. staff was nice food was terrible. i\\'ll never eat here again. the host was rude and violated ada laws! my dog is trained for seizure responses, and i had paperwork from my doctor explaining everything. my dog was quietly sitting next to me while i handed the papers to the host, and he asked for an id card. i explained to him id cards are not real, people buy those online and are complete frauds. i even informed him that in the ada website it clearly states ids are not real. i had paperwork, a vest and leash that have giant letters imprinted \"service dog\" but that was not enough. i told him that i could buy an id card right now in front of him to show him that\\'s not real. he said \"that\\'s our policy. if you don\\'t have an id you can\\'t eat anywhere.\" yeah there\\'s no way possible your policy is to break the law. \\n\\noh and then he has the nerve to say \"oh i have a bichon frise at home. is your dog a bichon? looks just like mine.\" no jerk. my dog is a trained for responding to my medical emergency. just because my dog is small like yours doesn\\'t mean it\\'s the same. \\n\\nso glad there was another restaurant 1 minute away that knew the laws. thank you to the unfriendly and untrained host for showing us a better restaurant. \\n\\nmanagement, train your staff https://www.ada.gov/archive/qasrvc.htm this location used to be the best....ordered a thin crust pepperoni and mushroom which was always a pleaser! not last night...i\\'m writing because it\\'s not a one off and hear is why...they changed the cheese and put way too much on so grease runs off the slices. the sauce is sweeter and they used to automatically square cut in which slices are small and east to handle! i had a few bites of one slice and threw the rest away! this place was so chaotic. we went on a weekday night when the credit card machines were down so i\\'m not sure if that was the explanation for the awful experience. the customer service was awful, no one knew what they were doing. long lines with zero organization. i will definitely never go back. i ordered the baja shrimp tacos and they were cold, what a joke! i will never come back here! i\\'ve been here a few times and as much as the service is always awesome. i can\\'t forgive them for what happened. \\n\\nit was a beautiful day so the boyfriend and i decided to take the motorcycles out. we decided to stop by home plate. the previous times i\\'ve had the breakfast and you can never go wrong with breakfast any time of the day. but we felt like pasta and decided on the spaghetti and meatballs for lunch. boyfriend decided to start with the shrimp. it was overly seasoned so we sent it back. the spaghetti sauce was also overly seasoned with pepper. but at that point i was hungry and just finished what i could. plus we had plans for the ride and we didn\\'t want to waste the day. \\n\\nlater that afternoon while riding near boulder highway i all of a sudden needed to use the restroom. i thought it was just me so i didn\\'t think anything of it. but when boyfriend started to have stomach pains also we put two and two together and found the culprit. \\n\\nour nice afternoon out on the bikes was cut short as we both raced back home. we will never be back. stay away!!!!!  absolutely atrocious pizza and wings!!  we went there for my daughter\\'s 5th birthday (luckily they don\\'t\\' know any better...)  i would never visit this dump again.  service was mediocre at best, the pizza sauce tasted like it had sugar in it, the dough was gross, the cheese was barely melted.  now let\\'s get to the wings....it really isn\\'t hard to make them.  you put them in the deep fryer take them out and toss them in sauce.  i ordered garlic/parm.  i got melted parmesan in a butter soup.  no taste of garlic.  fast forward......all of us had to run to the restroom several times after eating here and i\\'m still feeling it today.  i will spare the details....  i have never been so irritated with a restaurant before.  stay away!!!! i live in boulder city and wanted to take my grandson for pizza.  the help was not friendly and the pizza was mushy and undercooked.  we asked for it to be cooked a little longer and they acted put out.  will not return.  love vinny\\'s. ordered a pizza online...original pan pizza with stuffed crust. what was delivered was not what we were expecting. called and spoke with the manager mike who proceeded to argue with us...no apologies, no offers of a credit. we won\\'t be ordering from them again. where do i start!! this place is awful!! service was very inconsistent, it took 45 min for our appetizer to arrive,which was sub par. it wasn\\'t even busy just 3 tables occupied. \\ni got the meatball and potato wedges and the wedges weren\\'t cooked all the way through, and the burned the shit out of the garlic in my meatballs which left a bad taste in my mouth. oh yea!! the owner parks his ferrari right on the sidewalk out front the restaurant. who does that? there was also a drunk cop with his wife who kept saying how good the food was. it was like a scene from a bad dream. they comped both our meals as we were leaving the owner was out front talking to the drunk cop about his ferrari. obviously this guy is in la la land, maybe you should sell the ferrari and learn how to run a restaurant. food is bad, waitress was sweet, but i\\'m not going back. i\\'am not exaggerating one bit. this place must be losing money everyday. stay away i warned you!!!! service was great. however ordered the lasagna -- looked like mush, tasted like mush. salad was soggy and my entire meal was inedible. i expected more from an \"italian\" restaurant at the venetian. spoke with the manager, she said that i didn\\'t like it because i wasn\\'t familiar with the part of italy the recipe came from. what do you expect, it\\'s called fast food, not good food. the salads and bread are good, but, i could make this myself. the pre portioned entrees are dissatisfying to say the least. terrible pizza.  i can buy a better pizza at ht.  staff is very unfriendly. i don\\'t see why this has so many stars.  nasty is the word to describe the unsavory taste. i would rather drive 15 miles to wolfmans pizza. this is the former sushi joint on bell road. i was excited to try it out for lunch and brought my wing loving son with me.\\n\\nat first glance one wonders why they covered the exterior with metal sheets. it looks clumsy and hot. my son remarked that they should call it the oven.\\n\\ni want to be more elaborate but honestly it was a bad experience. i ordered a burger in a lettuce wrap, pink, and it was as dry as can be. tasted like there was liver in the mix. chewing on it dried out my mouth. i sent it back and ate only the modest side salad. the basil vinaigrette was delicious.\\n\\nmy son ordered the jumbo wings which were regular size and were \"okay\".\\n\\nin the end, with tip included for good service, i spent $24 for a small side salad, wings, and iced tea. i was not charged for the hockey pucks. i consider that amount a failure on both our parts.\\n\\nin response to mario: a poorly cooked burger cannot be redeemed with sauces. my burger had goat cheese and it was supposed to have aioli on it. that is sufficient to enhance the flavor yet it still fell short of even fast food quality. it is unsettling and revealing that you aren\\'t aware of this. grass feed beef is known to require a more gentle preparation than conventional meat. \\n\\nthe reviews are showing you to be someone inclined to manhandle guests and/or to forbid them from visiting your establishment again. surprise is not a community that will reward such behaviors. i strongly encourage you to get someone more amiable to represent your restaurant. blaming me for that tragedy of a burger has lost you yet another client. 這餐廳有很多連鎖店，我吃過很多家此分店食物是好的，但是這家餐廳的食物吃起來不新鮮，食物好像是已經放一些時間了，不新鮮有些糟糕，我不會再來這裡，但是服務人員是親切好的！ horrible service. rude people on the phone. delivered the wrong pizza. still tipped the driver $5 on a $15 pizza. quoted 45-1hr. got here in 1.5 hours. did not apologize. did not deliver to the elevator even when they asked my tower and room number. made me come to the valet. bad experience. \\n\\nlost the phone number for the best 24 hour pizza on the strip so if someone could recommend something, hollaaa at yo girl. \\n\\nand since i should talk about food...pizza tastes like the pizza they give you in elementary school. cheese = rubber\\n\\ngood thing: they gave me some cheese and pepper. cool.\\n\\n*edit: some properties don\\'t allow for the delivery guy to come up. they could\\'ve told me this. strange place... rocking club like music with a pretty big italian menu. we ordered the pizzas which were just ok. so annoyed!   so come to find out that this place has two different menus.\\none is the normal day to day w\\n\\nith decent prices.\\ntwo is a menu that they bust out on game days!  its limited and i understand they want to turn tables and have easy quick meals.   but to  raise your $$$$ prices because of the increased business after the game is ridiculous!!!!!  poor business ethics, poor management! not only will i not be back on game day but i won\\'t be back any other day.\\nalso,  their website states $10 16-inch pies on wednesdays and sundays but when we were there on sunday after the game they charged 17.50 and they said they no longer have the special even though it\\'s indicated on the website! the delivery guy took 20 minutes to find my address and he missed part of my order, pizza was cold just an awful restaurant. my order was incorrect and i was overcharged. so then after waiting forever in line i get to the window to find out i\\'m being charged for stuff i did not order! geeze! it was so frustrating i had just gotten out if work and wanted to grab good and go home! so after trying to explain my order for the third time i was just fed up, so i told the guy that i didn\\'t want anything that i would go somewhere else and proceeded to drive off. he sticks his head out of the window and yells \"next time dont smoke before you go order food!\" seriously the nerve! i had just worked a ten hour shift this guy was way out of line and highly unprofessional! who hires these people!? i will never go back there, and with the service they provide i would not recommend anyone else to. is this a joke? am i being punked?! this tastes nothing like chicago deep dish. it literally tastes like di giorno\\'s frozen pizza. maybe that\\'s why it takes so long to cook, they have to go fetch it from the grocery store. the garlic parmesan fries took forever to come out as an appetizer and when it did, they were limp and soggy, sad and uninspired. parking is ridiculous as well. service was ok, a little overbearing for my taste. what a waste of a palate. scratch this one off my list! we had to wait forever and the pizza wasn\\'t good.  i went with 5 other people and none of us liked our food. my husband had a gig there. he got paid by a check but was no good when he took it to the bank, can\\'t find anything on the noopi corporation and the owner of this establishment. if you like sweet crust, sweet sauce and cold pizza then this is the place for you! the crust was dry and so sweet that it could have passed for a mediocre cookie. and the sauce was sweet to the point of cloying. the cheese had already begun to congeal and harden by the time it came out. the wait staff dissapeared and were impossible to get a hold of. its as if they knew we\\'d send it back if they made eye contact.\\n\\nthe appetizers were pretty good but the portions were so paltry that they barely provided more than three bites. the description in the menu was that they were \"great for sharing\" um.... no, methinks not. \\n\\nhonestly this is the worst pizza i\\'ve had in years. i don\\'t understand the hype, perhaps just the pittsburgh ross park location is bad. but i know i won\\'t waste my time or money there again. if you want good pizza pretty much any other place will give you a better meal and for a lot less. \\n\\nmy recommendation for amazing wood fired pizza (and far cheaper) is piccolo forno in lawrenceville. i\\'m sure there are tons of great places in da burgh for pizza. cpk is not one of them. this place doesn\\'t even deserve 1 star. it got one star because of the wine and i brought my own. never have i ever experienced terrible service like this. our server katie was \"annoyed\" to open our wine, take our order and had a terrible attitude. our reservation was at 8:15....oh we are still here waiting for food! pathetic. waitress looked like a crackhead, dirty appearance. i was with a group so not at a comfort level of saying something just went with it. salad, breadsticks, pumpkin cheesecake and hours later in the bathroom need i say more...... i got some sushi from here and it was horrible!! it was filled with little fish bones throughout the entire two rolls i purchased!! don\\'t bother buying sushi from here!! i could have saved money by buying a frozen pizza from costco and bought frozen chicken fingers. pretty much what i received. won\\'t go back there. and we even picked it up, was not even hot..luke warm at best. what happened to this place? couple months ago the service and food was amazing! went there last night....horrible. waited 45 minutes to get the appetizer. then the food came out and it was the worst. food had no taste and the noodles were so soggy! we also ordered the sausage patty came out cold and raw in the middle. i will never be back. its sad cause it was so good the first time. 60 bucks for the worst food and service ever! had a horrible experience and we never even ordered!  went on sunday night and was seated promptly.  we then waited and waited and waited.  my wife watched another party that was seated after us, get some water and menus, get greeted by their waiter and then get some bread.  i finally got up and asked the manager if our table had a waiter assigned to it.  he said he would look into it.  water and menus arrived shortly thereafter.  a few minutes later perhaps the most rude waiter i have ever had arrives.  he doesn\\'t appologize, doesn\\'t smile or make eye contact and recites the special of the night while looking into the restaurant.  he says he will be back shortly while we look over the menu.  we then wait and wait and wait.  finally, we get up and leave.  on my way out i tell the manager.  the sad thing was he didn\\'t appologize nor appear to care.  very disappointing. i ordered 3 well done & thin pizzas. one cheese, one extra and one green pepper, sausage, onion. \\nwhen i got my pizzas they were soggy, undercooked and all the toppings were in the center and there was about 2-3 inches of crust. the pizzas were so thick and soggy. i asked for thin and well done.\\nso i called to see what was up with the pizzas and the woman on the phone was so rude. \\nso i paid for disgusting pizza and rude customer service. pizza hut would have been better than this. service was horrible. main courses were horrible. do not waste your money, appetite or time. the only thing that will keep this place open is the appetizers. if you have to come here, sit in the bar and order wine and appetizers. their \"specialty cocktails\" contained 0 alcohol. we just ate here with a group of six. we\\'re from out of town and had no idea that the restaurant was closing in 20 minutes.  we we\\'re seated on the sidewalk tables. and our waitress (her name was amanda) didn\\'t tell us about a last call then was very rude when our party asked to order more drinks. amanda even went as far as lying to us saying that she told us there was a last call. she neglected to stop by our table often enough for refills and brought us our 2 pizzas but didn\\'t show up with plates for us to eat off of for 5+ minutes. amanda might be better off working as a greeter at walmart. \\n\\nthe margarita pizza was a bit soggy, but the barbecue pizza was pretty good. they also serve lemonade in flimsy plastic cups... it\\'s been a long time since i\\'ve walked out on a meal, but i did it.  went for brunch today. waited 35 minutes for a plate that i wouldn\\'t serve my dog. my friend ordered a veggie dish and asked for her eggs to be cooked so the yolks weren\\'t runny. yes 35 minutes later, her dish arrived runny and with bacon. the server first blamed the oversight and the wait on the amount of orders - i counted four tables in the whole place. please. further, the server then blamed cooking the eggs specially. how long does it take to bake an egg? clearly 35 minutes and still they got it wrong. we paid for our drinks and left.  if you want to stay in the brunch game, step it up! overpaid dramatically for the terrible sandwich i received. really bad sandwiches in this dump. i hate giving money to people who don\\'t deserve it. not good for the money. not my thing. no sir i would not like another.'"

It's very obviously a relevant word for our target category, but is it useful in separating good and bad reviews? Probably not. We can also start to make some interesting observations that there seem to be more \"dull\" words here, such as \"told\", \"said\", \"came\", and \"went\".

    "Congratulations! You've achieved a lot since starting this project. You've related a business problem to a dataset and identified which data you needed. You've drilled into that data to answer an initial question of which food category the business should target. Then you've used knowledge gained from that to extract just the related reviews from a large file that, otherwise, would be too large to handle. You've further teased apart the best and the worst reviews to look at them separately and clearly seen there is a difference.\n",

    "The use of single words is a good start, but words occur in sequences and sequences can have much additional meaning. Consider a good review that said \"Highly recommended\" and a bad review that said \"Not recommended\". Analysing just single words, we would lose the \"highly recommended\" tag. What's more, with the approach of looking for words in good reviews that aren't in bad reviews, we would lose the word \"recommended\" entirely. Using sequences of two words, or bi-grams as they're known, would tackle this issue. Generally, in fact, we can consider n-grams."
